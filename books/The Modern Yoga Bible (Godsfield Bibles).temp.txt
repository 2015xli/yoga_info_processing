ATHA अ थ
The Yoga Sutras , as a codification of Hatha yoga, is an
important classic text, containing 196 concise aphorisms that
tell us exactly what steps to take to achieve the goals of
Hatha yoga. The first line of the Yoga Sutras – atha
yoganusasanam – means: “Now, the teaching of yoga”. So
atha is the very first word of the very first line of the Sutras.
While it’s meant as an introduction to the remaining
instructions, to me it means something more. What I love
about it is that if you can truly understand and integrate this
first word – now – you actually may not need the rest. If you
can fully apply the concept of bringing your mind to the
present moment, then you will be free. It’s liberating to allow
the past to drop away and to let the fantasies of the future
have less of an imprint. When you exist in the present
moment, so much stress just falls away. It is a beautiful
experience to be present to life as it unfolds.
Try chanting it: “Aa-Tha ” – the h gives the second syllable
a slight aspirated sound. The first syllable is a slightly longer
sound, with a rising intonation, and the second is a shorter,
falling intonation.

Do you know why you have opened this book? Yoga meets so many
needs, it’s no wonder its popularity has grown and grown. While you
may come to yoga with a physiotherapeutic goal in mind – hoping to
ease body aches and pains – it probably won’t take you too many
yoga classes to discover some of the other benefits. For many, yoga
develops into something that is more than just about lengthening and
strengthening. It becomes about living life better outside the yoga
room.
I am guessing that you could be looking at this book because you
would like to feel calmer, more peaceful and a little happier. To me,
what’s most beautiful about yoga practice is how expanded and
spacious I feel, both during and after it. When you find a practice that
suits you well, it’s easy to get into a flow-zone that is very uplifting,
and this can resonate long afterward. One of my students explained
how he often felt after class: “It’s as if all is right with the world.” This
is not insignificant. In a world where the daily news features tragic
stories of war, disaster, misfortune and violence, it can feel as if there
is frequently little that is positive out there for us. We need to be able
to peep our heads above any clouds of anger and hate that hang
over us. Yoga provides essential relief to the darker elements of our
worldscape. It reminds us that we can rise above aggression and
hatred and live well.
Yoga practice allows me to re-experience the beauty of who I am,
and to experience my body as a sanctuary. In a world where we are
often encouraged to be busy and materially productive, spending
time on yourself can be seen as selfish. I often remind my students
how, when you love someone very much, it is natural to want to
spend time with them. It becomes simple and effortless to give that
person your time. Rolling out your mat ready for practice is an
affirmation that you want to devote time to yourself. It is a great act
of love toward yourself and, from that, it becomes deeply healing.
The bottom line is that you can be happier practising yoga. And you
deserve to feel this way.
A regular yoga practice can make you feel calm and peaceful, as well as more limber.

When you follow the guidelines from the ancient texts, yoga is a
science. It offers us a logical series of steps that help us to live
better. The aim of yoga is to clear the mind, improve the quality of
the mind and understand the reality of the mind. The active postures,
or asanas , that make up most of this book are a helping hand to the
purpose of yoga. They will keep your body healthy, strong and limber.
They also prepare the body to sit with ease, so that you can practise
the mental focusing techniques that will help clear your mind. This is
all a terrific antidote to whichever imbalances are occurring in your
day-to-day life. As you read on, you will find that yoga has a solid
basis. But yoga is also an art and, with that, a little bit mysterious and
magical. How else can simply making a series of shapes with our
bodies have such a profound effect on our psyche, make us feel so
incredibly good and create such a vast number of yoga enthusiasts
worldwide?
Unlike Western psychology, which has tended to focus on
understanding those who are sick, Eastern psychology long ago
figured out the importance of positive thinking. Two thousand years
ago, Eastern yogis (practitioners of yoga) had already completed an
in-depth study of the nature of healthy minds, worked out how to
achieve self-realization and outlined how to deal with the pitfalls
encountered en route. Their techniques are sound and time-tested.
And what they discovered holds truer than ever today. While our
modern lives arguably see us moving ever further from our roots and
from that which keeps us grounded, those wise old yogis are still
holding a beacon of light and truth, to guide the rest of us forward.
In this book there are references to the two most-discussed
ancient texts: the Hatha Yoga Pradipika and the Yoga Sutras . The
Hatha Yoga Pradipika was written in the 15th century CE by
Svātmārāma; the important source known as the Yoga Sutras (see
also Ancient wisdom for modern life: Atha and Modern yoga – a great
workout and a superb work-in ) is a collection of aphorisms codified
by the sage Patanjali in about 400 CE . The Yoga Sutras are like a
recipe book, describing step-by-step what we need to do to achieve
Kaivalyam , the ultimate freedom. You’ll find quotes and inspiration
from the Sutras throughout the book, to guide you in your approach
to modern life.
Y o g a  p o s t u r e s  a n d  b r e a t h i n g
This book is about Hatha yoga, which is one of several branches of
yoga. It is the “yoga of effort” – the active yoga exercises most
commonly practised around the world today. Yoga was originally
taught by oral transmission in Sanskrit, the language used by
scholars. Asana is the Sanskrit word for the physical postures that
are familiar to yoga practitioners worldwide. The literal definition of
asana is “seat”, because you either “sit” into a yoga shape or are
comfortably seated to be able to move and take action in the world
with ease. The asanas are one of the “limbs” of yoga, and there are
seven others. Another limb encompasses the breathing techniques
(pranayama ).
E t h i c a l  c o d e s  o f  c o n d u c t
Other limbs of Hatha yoga relate to its profound and ancient
philosophy, which amazingly covers everything you need to do to be
able to achieve an enlightened state. You can read more about the
philosophy in the “Ancient wisdom for modern life” sections that you’ll
find dotted throughout this book.
The Sanskrit word for the physical yoga postures, asana, literally means “seat”.
Hatha yoga also includes two limbs that cover the ethical principles
of living, and these are called the yama and niyama . Together they
form a list of ten ethical observances that protect and support healthy
relational boundaries with yourself and others.
The five yamas encompass your intentions, thoughts and actions.
They are ancient concepts, and yet they still offer modern people a
perfect set of guidelines for living. They are:
• A h i m s a  – holding an intention of doing no harm to others
• S a t y a  – speaking truthfully
• A s t e y a  – not taking what does not belong to you, or that which is
not willingly given
• B r a h m a c h a r y a  – conserving your energy for your highest
aspiration
• A p a r i g r a h a  – taking only what is sufficient for your needs to
support you in living in alignment with your environment and the
people with whom you are in contact.
The five niyamas incorporate discipline in actions and attitudes
toward yourself. Although they were also written more than two
thousand years ago, these principles are as relevant today as they
were then. Put simply, it’s easier to be gentle toward, and respect,
others if you follow these guidelines:
• S a u c h a  – take care of yourself
• S a n t o s h a  – enjoy what you have in your life
• T a p a s  – apply some discipline to achieve your goals
• S w a d h y a y a  – understand yourself deeply through self-study
• I s h v a r a p r a n i d h a n a  – recognize that ultimately you are not wholly
responsible for the way things turn out, and that the world is greater
than you.
F o c u s ,  c o n c e n t r a t i o n ,  m e d i t a t i o n  a n d
e n l i g h t e n m e n t
You may already associate the next three limbs with yoga practice. A
certain withdrawal of the senses (pratyahara , the fifth limb) is useful.
It’s more challenging to have a quiet mind with a loud lifestyle; it’s
harder to have a focused mind with an action-filled life. Toning down
the constant stimulation of the senses will leave you better positioned
to develop your concentration (dharana , the sixth limb), in order to
be able to achieve a deeply meditative mental state (dhyana , the
seventh limb).
The eighth and final limb – and the aim of Hatha yoga – is
samadhi , which can be translated as “bliss”. It’s an experience that
will occur as a result of the seven other limbs. This natural state of
being, the samadhi state, is an experience of oneness.
M o d e r n  y o g a  –  a  g r e a t  w o r k o u t  a n d  a
s u p e r b  w o r k - i n
The essence of yoga is outlined in the first four points of Patanjali’s
Yoga Sutras :
1 .  The purpose of yoga is outlined in the first sutra , written in
Sanskrit as Yogash citta vritti nirodhah . This tells us that the state of
yoga is the cessation of the movements of the mind.
2 .  The second sutra informs us that the mind is the tool, and the way
to quiet the mind is to work with the mind. Only with a clean, clear
mind can we be in touch with the truth of the moment.
3 .  The third sutra tells us that the mind is also the goal. When we are
in the state of yoga, we won’t be led astray by distorted
understanding or incorrect thoughts. This sutra informs us that there
is no aspect of our lives that is untouched when we perceive things in
their true nature. It shines a different light on everything. Once we
can better understand reality, we can be helped to avoid the causes
of pain and will have control over more than we may imagine.
4 .  The fourth sutra tells us that the mind is actually also part of the
problem. This is because when the mind is disturbed, it is unable to
follow a direction or to comprehend things accurately. In this case, we
will move away from the state of yoga.
The remaining 192 sutras are an elaboration of these first four. If you
want to experience peace within, the Yoga Sutras will take you
through the steps that will lead you toward quieting the mind and
existing in the peaceful state of yoga.
From the Yoga Sutras we learn that only when we are in the state
of yoga will we know things as they truly are. When the mind is not in
that state, we are unable to see the true nature of things. So the aim
of yoga practice is to achieve a sustained mental quietness, in order
to be fully present and therefore able to understand and reflect true
nature. It’s a lofty goal, isn’t it? So I understand if you simply want to
focus on stretching out those tight hamstrings, for the time being. But
hang around yoga classes for long enough and your curiosity may
develop further, as those quiet relaxations at the end of the session
offer you more than just a glimmer of a new, very peaceful way of
being.
Breathe through a sudden surge of emotion that arises
unexpectedly in a forward bend, and feel yourself transformed and
somehow uplifted. As you exit the yoga room, you might feel like a
nicer, calmer, kinder or more tolerant person. Or perhaps, when you
are deeply touched by some event in your life, you may find yourself
guided through the doorway of yoga into discovering your inner
world. And you may find that your inner world is a sanctuary. Your
asana practice is then elevated beyond being simply a physical
workout or an effective de-stressing tool. As your body, mind and
psyche are inevitably intertwined, your Hatha yoga practice may
become a soothing place of solace for the heart, and a rewarding
journey of self-development.
W h y  m o d e r n  y o g a ?
Hatha yoga practice has evolved considerably since my original book,
The Yoga Bible (now available as The Classic Yoga Bible ), was
written 15 years ago. Thanks to advances in movement sciences and
more in-depth training, the therapeutic side of the physical postures
has developed. The popularity of Pilates means that modern yoga
puts greater emphasis on strength and careful alignment in the
pelvis, shoulder, back and abdomen. For example, modern yoga
classes now often feature a whole range of core-strengthening
practices that are quite different from what was on offer a decade
and a half ago.
Happily, yoga has moved from hippy to mainstream, and en route
it has opened up to more influences. Any art practised more widely is
bound to be influenced by the previous training of its practitioners.
Yoga teachers with backgrounds in martial arts, tai chi and qi gong
have married some of those principles to their yoga teachings, as
have teachers with other backgrounds: Feldenkrais, the Franklin
Method and the Alexander Technique, to name but a few.
In the 1980s yoga was heavily influenced by B K S Iyengar, an
accomplished Hatha yogi who is credited with bringing yoga to the
West in the 1960s. Iyengar yoga is characterized by long, strong
holds that build stamina and flexibility. And throughout the 1990s the
popularity of Astanga Vinyasa yoga brought the concept of continued
flow into regular yoga practices, spawning other faster, flow-based
practices that are popular in the West today.
Some practices feature one movement on each inhalation and
another on each exhalation. In other forms, a yoga practitioner might
pause for several breaths in a pose, then move straight on to another
pose. Flow yoga, in which the movements mirror the breath, is a
beautiful adjunct to static poses, where for newer yoga practitioners
the breathing can become a little difficult. And so sequencing has
become more sophisticated and creative, which means that a yoga
practice can feel like a poetic stream of movement.
Thanks to technology, it feels as if life moves faster now than it did
15 years ago. It’s as if our attention spans have diminished. So while
our interest in flow-yoga practices may reflect how we have sped
ourselves up, at the same time there has been a rebound toward a
new breed of slow yoga styles. As if to intuitively counterbalance
ourselves, restorative yoga and yin yoga have become more
important. Restorative yoga features soft, relaxed postures, each
held for many minutes; these poses are usually supported with
props, to soften the intensity of the poses. Yin yoga borrows from the
East, using the meridian (or energy-channel) systems found in
Chinese medicine. Rather than trying to change the muscles, it
targets the joints and connective tissues; it also features long holds,
where the intensity levels can be high in order to strengthen the
bones and ligaments.
While it may appear superficially that all these variations of yoga
practice provide different choices, in essence yoga remains
unchanged, and the original yogic ethos remains eternal. Despite all
the changes humankind has been able to manifest over the
centuries, and despite the myriad forms of yoga that will continue to
evolve, essentially we are still human beings for whom the timeless
practices of yoga remain absolutely relevant. The ancient yogis had a
fantastic understanding of the mind and how to calm it, and of how to
use yoga to care for our inner worlds (ourselves) and our outer
worlds (our relationships, other beings and the environment).
Yoga is a practice of evolution. One of the classic definitions of
yoga is: to achieve something not able to be reached before. This
inevitably results in personal growth and transformation. Aside from
the changes in Western yoga in recent decades, anyone who has
practised for many years will inevitably evolve themselves. Their
needs will alter and, as they do, their yoga practice will naturally tend
to change. Longtime yogis may relate to my own journey, which
began as a teenager in some sort of search for physical perfection –
and with a healthy dose of ego. Over the years it has changed from a
more cerebral search to understand each pose to the nth degree,
accompanied by attempts to attain “perfect” alignment or to achieve
the hardest possible variation of a pose, to become one that is much
less demanding and more of a reliable long-term relationship. I now
have a much softer attitude, a softer practice and, with that, a
delightful sense of fun and play. Thankfully I rarely feel the pressure
of having to “prove” anything. My relationship with yoga has evolved
into a nurturing, stable and rewarding marriage, and it serves me
well.
Restorative and yin yoga feature soft postures that are held for longer periods of time.

In positive psychology the concept of “flow-states” has become
popular, thanks to research by the Hungarian psychologist Mihaly
Csikszentmihalyi and his colleagues. The flow-state is an experience
of deep focus and rapture while you are performing an activity. This
experience, when you have full involvement and enjoyment of the
activity, is also known as being “in the zone”. It’s a pleasurable state
in which you feel complete absorption and where time flies. You can
experience flow in many places: during study, at work, while playing
music, making love, playing sport and during yoga practice.
Yoga scores highly in “flow” rankings when compared to other
sports activities in general. Ideally, during your Hatha yoga practice,
there is a loss of self-consciousness as your ego-state softens and
you lose your fear of failure. To make it more likely to reach the state
of flow, you need to balance your abilities with your attitude and the
level of difficulty of your postures. If you are choosing a simple
practice that is very easy for you, it’s even more important to
approach each pose in a curious, thorough and mindful way. When
you approach a familiar pose as if it’s your first time, we call it “the
beginner’s mind”. The freshness of the beginner’s mind will increase
the likelihood of you opening to the state of flow. Otherwise, apathy
or boredom will move you away from the flow experience. As your
skill in the postures increases, so too can the challenge of the
postures that you choose. With skill and challenge nicely balanced,
you lay the foundations for an optimal experience of flow. If the
challenge of the postures is too high for your skill level, anxiety will
result. And, as you will have gathered by now, anxiety is not the aim
of Hatha yoga practice, but rather the opposite.
Y o g a  a n d  n e u r o p l a s t i c i t y
When my original Yoga Bible was written 15 years ago, it was thought
that the brain was hard-wired by the age of five or six, but we have
now updated our understanding of the concept of neuroplasticity –
the brain’s ability to reorganize itself. Neuroplasticity has shown that
our brains are in a constant state of reorganization, depending on
how they are being used. Repeated, consistent patterns created by
new experiences can change the brain. (You can think of the brain as
a bit like a muscle: the worked-out bits get stronger, while the unused
parts get weaker.) With this in mind, it becomes important to fortify
positive patterns, and the yoga texts were all clear on this millennia
ago. They stressed the importance of a consistent yoga practice as
the key to success. Consistent practice affects how we feel, how we
deal with our emotions, how aware we are of our bodies and how
integrated we are on all levels. These benefits carry through to life off
the yoga mat.
Neuroplasticity also tells us what happens when we connect our
intention and concentration with our breath and physical movement.
Over time we form a positive association and it feels good. There’s
even a catchphrase for how the neural pathways behave: “What fires
together, wires together.” This is why you can quickly “drop in” to your
pleasant “yoga zone” as soon as you stand on your yoga mat. You
may notice that the first single upward sweep with your arms in a Sun
Salute makes you instantly feel better, more harmoniously integrated,
calm and at ease. It also means that, after some time with a regular
meditation practice, you can centre yourself down to a deep,
meditative mindset fairly efficiently when you sit.
It’s important to realize that the continued rewiring of the brain
works the other way, too. Each time you feel stressed, you are
reinforcing the neural networks for that uncomfortable experience.
This is where regularity of practice is important, so that you can
continue to amplify the good stuff and dampen down whatever you
don’t want to reinforce.
The nervous system has a neat reward system, of which Hatha
yoga is perfectly positioned to take full advantage. The body releases
feel-good chemicals called dopamine and endorphins. While there
are lots of other experiences that can make this happen as well –
listening to music, communal experience and other types of exercise
– there is a kind of sacred biochemistry with Hatha yoga practice.
During yoga the combination of mindfulness, deep breathing and
movement triggers the release of these chemicals, amplifying the
positive rewiring of the brain, and transformation occurs.
A good thing to add to this mix is the Loving-Kindness Meditation ,
which will help you to develop compassion and feel beautifully
connected to the community around you. And do practise the
Mindfulness Meditations and Gratitude before or after your active
yoga practices. Mindfulness, deep breathing and slowing movement
plus meditation are the perfect ingredients to help you become less
reactive, heal old wounds and deal with stress better. You will
become more appreciative of all you are and have. You will feel
happier and healthier, enjoy your body more, open more fully to love
and feel more at peace in the world.
H o w  t o  u s e  t h i s  b o o k
In this book you will touch and taste elements of the concepts
mentioned above. You will find yoga practices to suit your own needs.
There are practices for each different day and decade, as your ability,
energy levels and moods naturally change. There are postures to
make you strong and supple, and ones to freshen and refocus your
mind. There are practices to calm your emotions and make your
heart sing; there are experiences of serenity for your soul, as you
touch that nugget of peace that always resides within you, although
sometimes you’re just too busy to notice it.
To create the greatest impact in a short amount of time, there are
lots of combination poses, where the leg position of one classic pose
is matched with, say, the shoulder-stretching arm action of another.
There are also many flowing postures, which can reduce the intensity
and keep your breathing steady, so that you’ll feel good while you
practise. I have added a healthy dose of longer holds and lots of
emphasis on alignment; and I recommend doing a liberal amount of
Ocean Breath to keep you focused. Add a sprinkle of meditation and
relaxation, some guidance on mindfulness and voilà – you have the
great workout, with the superb work-in that is modern yoga.
To help piece your practice together, follow the sequences outlined
in Putting it all together . Alternatively, you can start at the front of the
book and choose one or two practices from each section, for a fairly
balanced routine. The text boxes include additional suggestions for
your practice, so that you can take different journeys on different
days; in these boxes you will find the following topics that will help
your travels through the book:
• b u i l d  u p  – offers a suggested preparatory pose
• m o v e  f o r w a r d  – gives an idea of where to go next in the book;
most of these progressions will deepen your practice by continuing
on the same theme (for example, moving from an initial twist to a
stronger twisting action)
• b a l a n c e  o u t  – gives directions to a posture that counterposes the
work just done (for example, moving from a twist to a symmetrical
pose, such as a forward bend, to help balance you out)
• u n w i n d  – suggests options to take the intensity down a notch, to
an easier or more relaxing posture
• t a k e  c a r e  – indicates that some postures are contraindicated for
certain conditions.
O n e ,  t w o ,  t h r e e  s t a r s  ☆  ☆  ☆
Be guided by the star system for the level of challenge. A pose
marked with one star is manageable for most bodies; three stars you
might have to build up to. The star rating assumes that you have no
injuries or particular restrictions. If you have a current or chronic
injury, or any significant tendencies toward certain issues, you will
need to adjust poses as necessary. Do refer to each section
introduction for general “cautions”, and to each pose for any specific
contraindications; and be sensible about not pushing yourself to the
point of injury, seeking further guidance where necessary. If you have
any recent or chronic injury anywhere, work under the supervision of
an experienced and knowledgeable teacher.
Be smart and leave your ego off the mat. Don’t push into pain, and
do seek qualified advice as you need it. Each individual will find that
they are looser or weaker in some areas, and tighter or stronger in
others. Just because you can achieve an admirable-looking pose that
has three stars next to it, don’t assume that opens the way for all the
other three-star poses. Yoga poses tend to be multifaceted, and they
work with many different lines of stretch and areas to strengthen.
Some practices will push your boundaries, requiring courage and
acting as a mirror to encourage you to expand the fixed edges in
your “real life” off the mat. Other practices are soft, sensual and
slinky – the psychological equivalent of sinking into a deep, soothing
bath at the end of a long day.
The essence of yoga is timeless, yet in modern times we need it
more than ever, as many of our lives fluctuate between stressed-and-
wired and stressed-and-tired. Its essence is noble, authentic and
deep, but you can still be playful, joyful and open to fun with yoga. I
hope you have lots of fun with this book.
G u i d e l i n e s  t o  p r a c t i c e
• J u s t  d o  t h e  b e s t  y o u  c a n .  Applying your best effort each day is
much better than achieving a “perfect practice”. Your yoga postures
don’t need to be glamorous or crowd-pleasing. Simple is often best.
Neuroplasticity means that mindful practice of simple poses will
create new positive patterns of being, and your inner journey is just
as important as creating new patterns in your physicality.
Progression is, of course, fine as you develop your physical
practice, but don’t be led astray by the wantings of your ego.
• D i s c i p l i n e  i s  e s s e n t i a l .  You will get results if you practise regularly
with dedication, curiosity and enthusiasm. Keep up your enthusiasm
by making sure that you choose lots of postures you enjoy doing.
Then you will feel good and are more likely to practise. Keep an
open mind and explore the things that challenge you, too.
• L e t  g o  o f  t h e  i d e a  o f  t h e  p e r f e c t  p o s e .  Aim to be perfectly in the
moment while you are in any pose.
• T a k e  b r e a k s  d u r i n g  y o u r  p r a c t i c e .  This offers you time to learn to
access the “in-between” spaces. Your body can then integrate the
positive changes, and that’s when deep healing occurs.
• S t h i r a  s u k h a m  a s a n a m  (Yoga Sutras II:46) is an important sutra . It
tells us that a yoga pose should be steady and comfortable. You
need to remain alert, yet feel relaxed in the postures. A posture
shouldn’t create burnout and needs to be sustainable. Watch your
breath, and change what you are doing if your breath becomes
irregular. While each Hatha yoga pose will imprint on the breath, it
mustn’t stop the flow or make it feel jagged or jarring. Check in with
your breathing often. It’s the barometer to the way you are feeling.
• D o n ’ t  j u s t  d o  s o m e t h i n g  –  s i t  t h e r e !  The active practice of the
yoga poses by themselves is not enough. You need to explore the
breathwork, relaxations and meditations as well. Even five minutes
of Mindfulness Meditation can be life-changing if practised daily.
• S e n s e ,  f e e l  a n d  a c t  a p p r o p r i a t e l y  – always with presence and
compassion. Every yoga pose offers you the choice of how much
effort to put in and how relaxed to be in the pose. More relaxation
often means more enjoyment. If you have a rather driven
personality, give yourself full permission to hang back from your
edge. It may confront you to take things easy, but sometimes the
best development means getting out of your comfort zone. The
timings offered in this book are guidelines only, so you can set your
own thresholds during your practice, in terms of the length of holds
and the depth of your movements.
• L e a r n  t o  t r u s t  y o u r  o w n  p e r c e p t i o n s .  Use your yoga practice to
develop your intuitive skills. Every day you have a whole lot of
different cells that you didn’t have yesterday. Effectively you have a
new body, so meet each pose and each practice afresh.
• Y o u r  i d e n t i t y  o r  v a l u e  a s  a  p e r s o n  is not linked to how “perfect”
your Lotus pose is, how long you can hold a Headstand or how
handsome you appear in a pose. Trust me – at your funeral,
nobody will be talking about how long your hamstrings were.
Every yoga pose offers options, letting you choose the version that feels right for you.

I am frequently struck with a sense of honour when a student who is
brand-new to yoga turns up to class. In the back of my mind is the
thought that, for this person, the experience may be the beginning of
a lifelong love affair with yoga practices.
Regardless of your experience – brand-new or accomplished yogi
– you can delight in your yoga practice. We are all subject to the ups
and downs of life, so this doesn’t mean your life will always be pain-
free. We all have days when our bodies feel stiff, weak or wooden, so
it doesn’t mean you will feel strong or flexible in every single pose.
We all have times when our minds are scattered or lethargic, so it
doesn’t mean each practice will feel anchored and easy. It doesn’t
mean you will never experience negative emotions, or that you will
feel instantly free of reactions to the seeds implanted by your past.
However, your practice can be a deep and helpful solace for you.
Through the intertwining of the body, mind, psyche and reality, yoga
practice can help you become compassionate, courageous and
resilient. The practices can lift you out of a state of pervasive
dissatisfaction and can ease a mind that is chronically ill at ease. The
postures, the breathing, the relaxations and meditations can all shine
sunlight for you on those days when you feel hurt, raw or struck by
cosmic sadness. They can embrace you in times of quiet desperation
or unconscious despair. They can cup your heart in the depths of
grief, support you through trauma and hold your hand when you are
on the edge. In the most natural and wholesome way, yoga can
reconnect you to who you truly are.
Yoga restores our relationship to being. Whether or not we
experience it as such, we all start from wholeness. So during our
Hatha practices, our breathwork, our relaxations and our meditations,
we proceed from wholeness. And we return to wholeness. How
beautiful to realize that you are already perfect, and at the end of the
day you can be present to life as it unfolds.

AHIMSA अ   ह  स ा
Modern yoga is kind. The first ethical principle (yama ) of
Hatha yoga is that of ahimsa , which is often translated as non-
violence or non-harming, so it’s easy to think of it as the
avoidance of aggression. However, ahimsa runs deeper than
simply avoiding hurtful behaviour. Ahimsa also encompasses
kindness, compassion and acceptance.
While it’s uncomfortable for us to admit it, violence is a part
of human nature. You can see it in a toddler’s tantrum. You can
see it in relationship breakdowns, or in grown-ups at war. We
all have within ourselves the potential to be aggressive, unkind
and violent toward ourselves and others. However, as our
relationships interconnect us all, it’s in your own interest to
learn how to cultivate being kind to yourself, and to practise
extending this kindness toward others.
While you may at times feel powerless to change the
violence in the outside world, what you can do is ensure that
it’s not a reflection of what lies within. You can clean up your
own act and consider your thoughts and actions in the light of
ahimsa . To develop compassion and empathy, a really useful
practice is the Loving-Kindness Meditation . In this classic
Buddhist practice you fill yourself with the energy of loving
kindness, so that you’ll have it in abundance to share with
others. Then you share it out with other beings.
The precept of ahimsa includes not harming nature.
Environmental sustainability is vital, so cut pollution, recycle
and reduce consumption. Remember back in kindergarten,
when you learned the difference between wants and needs?
Reconsider your purchases in this light, to limit the greediness
that our materialistic world encourages.
Your modern yoga practice needs to be sustainable, too.
You need to ensure that your practice meets your needs and
nourishes you. Modern yoga understands that correct
alignment is essential to a sustainable practice. For example,
check that you’re not setting your shoulders up for a burnout
situation, due to repeated push-ups or incorrect alignment.
Modern yoga is dynamic, and your practice will change
according to your needs and moods.
In a modern yoga practice you get to choose how much you
work in each pose, and how much you relax within it. There will
be days when the kindest thing you can do for yourself is to
take it easy and include lots of restorative options and
relaxation in your practice. As your body is constantly being
rebuilt, the body you practise yoga with today is different from
the body you practised with yesterday – there are a whole lot
of new cells there, which have been created with a fresh,
positive attitude.
Getting to know who we are requires non-judgement,
compassion and curiosity. It also requires acceptance of body
and mind. Ahimsa encompasses complete self-acceptance at
a very deep level. In this light, you don’t need to change
anything at all. What is it like to realize you are already
perfect?

I can’t speak highly enough of the yogic limbering practices. As
they are often less demanding physically than other poses, it
means the breathing can relax and open. This is invaluable for
the health of both body and mind. Limbering sequences are
frequently used as preliminary practices, preparing the body
for some tougher work to come, but any of these sequences
are equally lovely to insert – in a kind of “less is more” way –
throughout your practice. They will help to re-centre you, and
you will enjoy the fact that they can be all-engrossing and yet
non-demanding, in this crazy-fast world of high expectations.
They can also help settle your body at the end of a workout,
allowing you to slip into serenity using your relaxation or
meditation techniques.
Pep yourself up with one or two of these practices during a
busy workday and you’ll revive your tired mind and soothe your
soul. These manageable sequences are suitable for just about
everybody’s body, and a selection of them can create a
complete practice, too (see Putting It All Together ).
Remember not to confuse intensity with the quality of your
yoga practice. Just because these sequences are gentle, that
doesn’t mean they are not sophisticated and valuable for every
single yoga practitioner. I hope you enjoy these mini-workouts
as much as I do.

1 .  Sit on your heels with your big toes touching and your knees wide
apart. Bring your palms together in prayer. This first time, before you
begin to move, take some time to notice the shape of your spine as
you sit here. Observe how your tailbone tucks lightly under, then
notice the sacrum bone – that broad plate of bone leading to your
lower back. Enjoy the long inward arch of your lower back, and how
the mid- and upper back round softly outward. Finally, notice how
your neck curves inward a little. Enjoy the way your head balances
easily on the very top vertebrae. Just acknowledging these parts can
allow tensions to melt away.

2 .  Take a breath in, then interlace your fingers and, turning your
palms forward, exhale as you press away through the heels of the
hands. At the same time, use your abdominals to help you tuck your
tailbone under strongly, then round your upper back. Really go for it,
with this action. Press out actively with your palms to help you cleave
the shoulder blades away from each other. You want to create the
maximum distance between your upper back vertebrae and your
hands.

3 .  Catch the wave of your next inhalation and sweep your arms up to
vertical, or even further back, reaching beyond vertical. As you do
this, change the shape of your spine to a long concave shape.
Strongly tilt your pelvis forward. Your chestbone will lift as you create
a tall backbend and you will feel a great shoulder stretch. You want to
enliven the whole of your spine, so focus on doing a little less with the
neck vertebrae while feeling more in the spine from the neck down.

4 .  As you exhale, take your arms and fingers out wide to the side.
Keep your spine in a backbend shape and reach the arms as far
back as possible, to get a stretch across the chest muscles. Make
the movement slow, so that it lasts as long as your entire exhalation
does. Inhale again as you float your palms together in prayer in front
of your chest. As your spine returns to its normal four curves, allow
the softness to come into it and into the whole body. Repeat this
breathing sequence five to ten more times.

1 .  Begin on all fours. Inhale and take your right leg back and up, so it
reaches as high up as possible. At the same time, curve your spine
into a downward arch as you feed your chest through your upper
arms. Allow your neck vertebrae to join the rest of the spine in this
backbend, but as the neck is already flexible, place your mental
emphasis more on the rest of the spine, particularly the thoracic
vertebrae of the mid- and upper back.

2 .  Exhale as you round the spine in the opposite direction and bring
your right knee into your chest. Feel your abdominals drawing inward,
toward the spine, as you push the floor away with your hands.
Continue for several rounds. Inhale to concave your spine. Exhale to
curve it up with your right leg, reaching out like the tail of a tiger, then
drawing in.

3 .  Add the arm-strengthening work from the backbend position, with
your leg still lifted behind. To work your triceps, ensure your inner-
elbow creases are facing forward, then bend both elbows backward
and lower them toward the floor. Ensure both upper-arm bones are
parallel as you do this, and that the elbows do not splay apart.
Straighten your arms, keeping your right foot at exactly the same
height as it was, so that you get a beautiful squeezy feeling in the
kidney area. Keep your hip position fixed – check your hips are not
moving backward as you lower yourself down (you won’t feel that
good triceps-muscle burn if they are). Complete eight push-ups,
exhaling down and inhaling up. Then bring the knee into the chest
once again before lowering it down to the floor. You are now ready for
your left side.

1 .  Start on your hands and knees. Reach your right fingertips out to
the floor in front and take a slow breath in.

2 .  As you exhale, slowly slide your fingertips back past your knee. At
the same time, move your hips toward your heels. Take the whole
length of your exhalation to do this movement. You are not at your
work desk now – remember: moving fast in yoga is not more
efficient. Take your time and enjoy the lazy exhalation.

3 .  When you feel your inhale begin, lift your right hand up into the air
and rise up onto your knees again. Create a huge circle, to return
your fingers to their starting position on the floor out in front.
Exhaling, begin your next circle by sliding backward once again. Lock
your gaze onto your moving thumb for the whole circle. As your right
arm approaches the vertical, push your left palm firmly down and see
if you can feel the rebound “bounce” that enables your right arm to
reach one notch higher. Continue for five or more rounds. Then sit up
and feel the difference in the two halves of your torso. Most likely
your right side will feel looser, warmer, more open and relaxed.
Repeat on the left side.

1 .  Sit with your legs apart in a V-shape. Before you start to move,
press your hands onto the floor behind your hips and rotate your
pelvis into a forward tilt. Then try removing your hands. If you find
your pelvis just tilts backward, bend your knees up as much as you
need to, to comfortably maintain this forward tilt for the entire
sequence. You will be able to straighten them a little more toward the
end. If it’s easy to maintain your anterior pelvic tilt, play with
anchoring yourself during the sequence by keeping the backs of your
knees pressed toward the earth and flexing your feet, to pull your
toes back toward your torso. Inhale and interlace your fingers,
reaching your arms forward and all the way up. Press the heels of
the hands away. Enjoy the sensations of your back muscles
squeezing, and notice how your heart centre elevates.

2 .  Now exhale and tip your whole torso forward as you bend your
elbows to float your interlaced fingers just in front of the chest. Still
on that same exhalation, reach your arms forward as you fold from
the hips into a forward bend.
3 .  Inhale and contract your abdominal muscles as you bend the
elbows again, to bring your hands near the heart and then reach
them up overhead. Then exhale, revolve your abdomen to the right
side and, still on the same long exhalation, drop the hands down to
chest level and then reach both arms and torso forward over your
right leg. Try to line up your chestbone with your thigh bone. Don’t
drop the head; instead, reach out and away through the crown of the
head every time you fold forward.

4 .  Inhale to come up and de-rotate, and lift to extend the crown and
the palms up to the sky. Exhale as you fold forward again, torso
between the thighs. Then breathe in to come up and, on your next
exhale, twist left and fold over your left leg. Inhale to return to centre.
Exhale to fold forward again. Continue working through the centre
and the sides, four times each. To take the load off the lower back,
bend the elbows, so that the hands travel near your heart as you
move into and out of each forward bend. Then take your hands to
the floor to hold in each of the three forward positions for five
breaths.

1 .  From all fours, reach your right arm out so that your hand touches
the floor in front, thumb up. Extend your left leg out behind you, with
the toes tucked under, touching the floor.

2 .  Inhale to prepare and then, on an exhalation, lift your right arm
and left leg up to horizontal. As you lift both limbs, draw your
abdominal muscles in, to lift your belly away from the floor. This will
stop your lower back drooping down and will keep a sense of length
in the lumbar spine.

3 .  Inhale to lower the right little finger to the floor and the left toes,
then exhale to lift them again, staying mindful not to allow the belly to
slacken toward the floor. Exhaling while lifting the limbs may feel a bit
counter-intuitive, but it will help activate the abdomen and stabilize
the pose. Repeat six rounds as you inhale to touch down, then
exhale to lift up again. While the arm extends out and away, be sure
to anchor the top of the arm into its root, creating a feeling of
bringing the head of the upper arm bone into the shoulder girdle.
Draw your right shoulder blade down toward your left hip to
accentuate this feeling.
4 .  Progress to Kneeling Bow Pose. Bend your left knee and reach
your right arm back to catch your foot. Lift your foot high in the air.
Allow your spine to move into a deep back-bend. Your lower back
already knows how to bend backward, so mentally emphasize the
backbend in the thoracic spine. Move your chestbone forward and
up. Then lift the left foot higher, to feel more of a stretch in your
quadriceps. After five to ten long breaths, come out. You are now
ready for side two.

1 .  Lie on your back with your knees bent in, feet in the air. Switch on
your abdominal muscles to bring your thighs closer to your belly. Take
your arms straight out to the sides, palms down. Exhale to move
both legs toward the right. Start small, so that your knees are still
floating in the air. Inhale as you bring your legs back up to symmetry.
Exhale and move to the left. Continue exhaling down and inhaling up,
alternating sides.

2 .  As your body gets warmer, you may like to travel further. It might
feel good to take your legs all the way to the floor each time.
Continue to work with the breath as you flow from one side to the
other.

3 .  Come to stillness by dropping your legs all the way to the right
side. If you are injury-free, it’s okay if your left shoulder pops up;
otherwise, try to nestle it closer to the floor. Widen the left shoulder
blade away from the vertebral column and slide your left hand further
away along the floor. The next part is really simple: rest and breathe.
Enjoy this for a minute or more. When you are ready for side two,
activate your abdominal muscles and bring your legs up, one at a
time, to protect your lower back.

1 .  From all fours, step your right foot between your hands. With your
front knee at a right-angle, slide your left knee back until you feel a
good release in the front of the left hip. You can do this whole
sequence with your back knee on the floor, and you can pad under
the knee, if you like.
If you feel ready, tuck your left toes under and lift your left knee. As
you do this, resist letting the hips lift. You want to squeeze that left
knee upward, yet keep the hips low, as you reach the front knee
forward more. Push down through your left palm and, as you inhale,
reach your right arm out wide and up. While both knees move away
from each other, so you also want to separate the distance between
both hands. Look up to the top thumb and stay in this twist for
several long breaths.

2 .  Return your right hand to the floor and lower your left knee to the
floor. By now you may be ready to slide your front foot further
forward. Lift your right big toe up, so that the weight rests on the
outer blade of your foot. Press your right hand against the inner knee
to allow it to sway out to the right side. Keep your right hand on the
knee as you twist your torso deeply to the right. Lower your hips and
feel the stretch in your inner right thigh. Stay for several breaths,
then repeat on side two.

side. Position your foot so that the instep lines up with the left knee
and your right toes point straight forward. Press down on the little-toe

left palm to the floor, also in line with your left knee, fingers pointing
to the left. Reach your right arm overhead, past your right ear. Stay
for several long breaths, allowing the whole of the side to elongate.

2 .  Now let’s strengthen. Reach your right arm up to vertical. Lift your
right leg up to hip height. Internally rotate your right thigh a little, so
that the kneecap angles slightly downward and your toes hang
toward the floor. Exhale as you lower your toes to the floor, and
inhale to bring the leg up again. Repeat five to eight times.

3 .  Develop your back-bending flexibility by bending your raised knee
and reaching your top hand behind to grasp the foot. Press your right
heel back away from the buttock. Enjoy the stretch in your right thigh
and the front of your hip. Once you have developed your backbend
shape, rotate your ribcage upward and shine that light in your heart
up to the sky. Look up, if it suits your neck. Hold for five breaths.
Then repeat on side two.

1 .  Stand with your feet about 90cm (35in) apart. Turn your toes out a
little and slide your knees into a wide, high squat, aiming each knee
over the second toe below. Start with your palms together at the
chest, then inhale and interlace your fingers as you reach both arms
out in front and sweep them up overhead.

2 .  On your next exhalation, lift your left side ribs and tilt your torso
over to the right. Then inhale upright again. Exhale and side-curve
toward the left. Then inhale back up again.

3 .  As you next exhale, squeeze your abdominal muscles to twist your
torso to the right. In many yoga positions your arms are available to
help you twist deeper, but not here. So grab this abdominal-
strengthening opportunity and squeeze on your core muscles to
swivel as far as you can. Inhale to return to the middle, then exhale
and twist to the left before breathing in to return to the middle.

4 .  Now exhale to sweep your arms wide out to the side and down.
Interlace your fingers behind your back. Inhale and lift the chest, to
create a backbend. Get a better shoulder stretch by lifting the hands
higher. Straighten your legs and move your big toes closer together,
so that the outer edges of your feet are parallel. Exhale and fold
forward, while you take your hands overhead, still interlaced. Stay in
this wide-legged forward fold for several breaths. Inhale to return to
upright, bending the knees if you need to protect your back. Swivel
the feet to turn the toes out and bend your knees once again. Return
the hands to a prayer pose and repeat the sequence, this time
moving toward the right side first. Then do two more complete
rounds.

1 .  Sit with your legs together, extended out in front. Inhale as you
reach the arms forward and up. Feel your back muscles activate, and
switch on your triceps (underarm) muscles.

2 .  Wait for your exhalation and use it to sweep the arms and your
torso forward. Don’t be concerned about how far your hands reach.
Think “out” rather than “down”, so instead of aiming your forehead to
your legs, send your energetic reach outward through the top of your
head. This will create the sense of lengthening the spine from the
tailbone toward the crown and will maintain a better alignment.

3 .  On your next inhalation, activate your abdominal muscles and
sweep your torso and arms up. Then, as you exhale, place your
palms on the floor behind your hips. Your fingers can point either
forward or backward. Point your toes, inhale and lift your hips and
heart forward and up. Resist the urge to drop the head all the way
back. Instead, keep a sense of connection from chin to throat, so
that you feel some muscle activation in your throat. With straight
knees, press the big-toe knuckles down strongly and roll your thighs
inward toward each other. Exhale and lower your hips to the floor.
You are now ready to inhale and take your arms up once again.
Repeat five to ten times.

1 .  Sit with your left shin in front of you and bend your right knee
back, so that your heel is near your right hip. Snuggle your right
sitting bone down to the floor. Inhale and raise both arms up
overhead, and sense your spine lifting tall. Exhale and, keeping the
length in the spine, float your arms down and twist to your left. Place
your right hand on your left knee and take your left fingertips to the
floor behind you. Use pressure on both hands to ease deeper into
the twist.

2 .  Get ready for the lateral stretch. Inhale your arms up overhead
again. Exhale and bring your right hand to the floor, wide of your right
foot, and increase the curve toward the right by reaching actively
through to the top hand. Now set up your beautiful flow. Inhale as you
bring your arms overhead again. Exhale as you twist left. Inhale to
come out again and exhale straight into the side-bend. Continue for
five more rounds.

3 .  Finally lift into a longer hold, to stretch the front of the hips. From
your last side-bend, take your left hand back around, as if to return to
the twist. Press the floor away with your left hand as you extend your
right arm up and back, lifting your hips in the air. Press your hips
forward and lift your chest. Stay for five breaths. Then repeat on side
two.

1 .  Stand with your feet hip-width apart and your arms by your side in

2 .  Reach your arms up overhead. Bend your right arm to grasp your
left elbow. If possible, position your right forearm behind your head,
but try to keep your neck and head in a neutral position. Anchor
yourself to the earth by pressing down through the soles of your feet.
Work the legs by activating your front thigh muscles to lift your
kneecaps. Take a long inhalation and extend from your ankle bones
all the way up to your elbows. Feel the two side-lines of your body
come alive. Continue the reach up to your left fingers. As you exhale,
sway your torso to the left. Increase the shoulder stretch by moving
your left arm away from your left ear.

3 .  Inhale to come up to standing again. Exhale as you move your
right hand down a little to grasp the middle of the left upper arm.
Inhale to grow tall, and once again exhale to curve to the left. Sway
your arm as far wide as possible. Remember to imprint your feet
nicely into the ground.
Inhale to come back up. If possible, grasp your left deltoid (shoulder-
cap) muscles with your right hand. If your head has been pressed
forward, move the back of the skull backward to realign your head to
neutral. Inhale, grow tall again, then exhale and for the third time lean
to the left. Reach out with your left arm and sway it away from the
head. Inhale to lift up and return to standing in Mountain Pose, with
the arms by your side. Take some time to notice how and where your
body has released, before you start side two.

1 .  Begin on all fours. With an inhalation, hover your right knee in the
air to bring it forward between your hands. Have it far enough
forward that your right foot is able to clear your left knee.

2 .  Exhale and slide your right foot down the left side of your left shin
to stack your right knee in front of your left knee. As you perform this
sliding action, take your buttock back to your left heel. Curve your
tailbone under and lift your lower and middle back toward the sky.
With your hips settled back and down, you will feel a stretch in the
left buttock area.
3 .  Inhale to return your right knee between your hands, ready for the
next movement. Take the rounding out of your spine, so that it’s in a
more neutral position, with a light abdominal contraction so that your
belly lifts up away from the floor.

4 .  Exhale and lengthen your right leg away, landing your foot on the
floor, toes tucked under. Press your right heel away to create a light
calf stretch. Inhale to begin the next round, again moving the right
leg. The movements will become noticeably more fluid and enjoyable
as your body softens. Repeat for five to ten rounds. Sit back, create
fists and circle your wrists a few times in both directions. Then enjoy
working the left side.

The Dog is my desert-island pose – if I had to choose one from
the thousands of yoga postures, I would select the simple and
affectionately named Dog. A soft inversion, this pose is also an
arm-strengthener, a shoulder-stretcher, a back-lengthener, a
hamstring- and calf-loosener and a brain-refresher. Surely it
would be greedy to ask for more from a single pose.
The Classic Downward-Facing Dog is a great linking pose.
From any wide-legged standing pose, it’s easy to cartwheel the
hands to drop into Dog; do this between working on your left
and right sides. And as part of a Sun Salutation, it feels so
inviting to stay and linger while you watch and steady your
breath.
You can spend years developing and finessing your Dog
Pose prowess. Stretching and strengthening in equal parts,
this pose may highlight areas where your body is more limited.
But don’t be dispirited if it feels like hard work at the beginning.
Keep on practising and you will find that the posture becomes
less arduous and you can relax deeply in the pose. Then the
rewards will be apparent, and you’ll understand why this head-
down triangular shape has become synonymous with yoga
around the world.

1 .  You can start this pose on hands and knees, but the first few times
you practise it, here’s how to find out what spacing suits you best. Lie
face-down on the floor. Bend your elbows up to place your palms on
the floor at chest level with your thumbs at nipple level.

2 .  Without changing the position of your palms or knees, push up
onto your hands and knees. With your knees and feet hip-width
apart, spread your fingers and thumbs wide and tuck your toes
under. Now set up the forward tilt for your pelvis for this pose, by
lifting your sitting bones and letting your abdomen drop, as you
accentuate the downward curve in your lower back.

3 .  Check that your palms are shoulder-width apart and press into the
floor. Maintaining the forward pelvic tilt, lift your knees and send the
hips up and back. Stay on tiptoes and keep a bend in your knees so
you will be able to bring your spine to a fairly straight position. You
want to send the hips energetically up away from the wrists, as far
back and high as possible. Have your ears positioned between the
upper arms, to keep your neck in a neutral position. Ensure that your
chin is not tucked in, which would flatten the neck, and don’t create
any wrinkles in the back of your neck, due to over-arching it.

4 .  To maintain that lumbar curve, take your time straightening your
legs and lowering the heels toward the floor. Contract your
quadriceps muscles, so that the kneecaps lift. It’s not the aim of this
pose to have your heels on the floor: instead, aim to get maximum
length through the back of the body. It’s great to have a little space
between the heels and the floor. Ensure that the index finger and
thumb knuckles are well anchored down. Now roll your shoulders out,
so that you broaden the shoulder blades away from each other:
imagine that you have an eye in each armpit and you want to look
cross-eyed. Hold and enjoy for five to ten breaths, then rest. If your
wrists start to ache, then that’s enough of this pose for the day; aim
to build up your strength over time.

This relaxing option is a great alternative to the classic Dog, if you
are lower in energy or just want to give your shoulders a really good
stretch-out.
1 .  From all fours, walk your hands forward and lower your chest as
close as possible to the floor. Keep your hips above your knees and
enjoy the hammocky shape of your spine. As your hips reach up and
back, allow your navel and heart centres to drop down, so that you
can experience the special shoulder-release.
Most people like to touch their foreheads to the floor in this pose. If
you are more flexible, then you may prefer to rest one cheek to the
floor. If you are even more open through the back and shoulders, you
may like to rest your chin to the floor, so that you gaze forward (as
long as this feels good for your neck). Rest here for five to ten
breaths.

This option is for those whose arms are still building up the weight-
bearing ability demanded by the classic Dog.
1 .  Stand with your feet wide apart and your toes pointing straight
ahead. Fold over and walk your hands away, keeping them shoulder-
width apart. Keep your hips directly above your ankle joints. Your
upper body will be on an incline. As in a regular Dog Pose, you want
to keep a long, flat feeling in your spine. In order to maintain that
slight inward curve with the lumbar spine, you may do well to bend
the knees; or you could place your hands on yoga bricks for a bit of
height. Aim to close the gap between your armpits and the floor a
little, even while you send a charge of energy through your elbows to
lift them away from the floor; coming up onto your fingertips will help.
Notice how long you feel through your front body, from your pubic
bone to your throat. This will help you to enjoy some slow, deep
inhalations and long, languid exhalations.

So much of yoga focuses on lengthening the hamstring muscles, but
it’s important that they are strong, too. This pose will strengthen one
set of hamstrings as the other side lengthens.
1 .  From the Classic Downward-Facing Dog Pose , lift your right leg to
horizontal. Keep your hips level, so that you create a flat line from left
to right across the buttocks. While your palms actively press the floor
away, enjoy a lifting energy in the arms as you squeeze the arm
muscles. Ensure your raised leg is truly straight by firming the
muscles around the kneecap. Look back at your raised leg: check
that your toes point straight down to the floor, rather than turning out
to the right. This way, your right hamstrings are getting strong. Send
a message to your left hamstrings to release, and lower your left heel
closer to the floor.

What a gorgeous feeling this release in the front of the hip gives, as
you soar one leg skyward.
1 .  From the Classic Downward-Facing Dog Pose , step your feet
together. Turn your right toes out and lift your right leg up into the air.
Maintain the even pressure through both palms, and check that your
shoulders continue to roll out – a great opportunity to undo the
hunching that tends to occur from long hours at a desk. While your
shoulders stay level and symmetrical, allow the right hip to lift much
higher than the left. This will give a lovely sense of “traction” through
the abdominals. The left heel has a tendency to sneak up in the air,
so press it down. Squeeze the muscles on the front of the right thigh,
to further soar your right leg high. Press out through the ball of the
right foot and fan the toes. Take this opportunity to separate your two
feet further apart than they have ever been before – yum! Return
your feet together to move on to the second side. Rest in the Child
Pose in between, if you need to.

This strongly levered twist is very strengthening for your supporting
wrist, arm and shoulder – and your torso comes alive, too.
1 .  Take the Classic Downward-Facing Dog Pose , but with the hands
a little closer to your feet than usual. Bend your right knee and lift
your right heel high in the air. Squeeze on the muscles of your right
arm and press your right palm into the floor. Ensure there is plenty of
pressure through the right thumb and index finger, too. Reach your
left hand back toward the inside of your right leg. Hook your palm
around the back of the left leg, as low down as possible. You might
by grasping the upper or mid-calf at first, but in time aim for the inner
heel.

2 .  Now straighten your right knee and lower your right heel as much
as possible. Create a spiral of energy through the torso, by
reinforcing the upward reach of the right hip. Revolve your torso to
the right side and look up under your armpit. Enjoy several long
breaths, then practise the second side. Rest in the Child Pose .

The special ankle action of this pose feels as if it creates space in the
hip joint, while you get a really toning twist to the torso.
1 .  From the Dog-Pose Split , bend your right knee and bring the heel
toward the right buttock. Strongly squeeze your thigh muscles to
press your right knee up and far away. Move the ankle joint between
flexion (with toes fanned) and extension (with toes pointed). After
hinging at the ankle a few times, press the heel away, to hold the
flexing action. Now rotate your chest and belly to the right, allowing
your right shoulder to lift slightly. Tuck your chin in and look up under
the right armpit. Now try twisting the less-obvious way, by turning
your head and chest to the left, while dropping your right shoulder
and lifting your left. If you reinforce your right hip to maintain its lift
and keep reaching through the right knee, you can create a
marvellous sense of release in the abdominal muscles. It can feel as
if this pose is working even deeper than just on this muscular level –
as if even the organs of the abdomen get more space, as they float
in upside-down suspension.

1 .  Start with your right leg up in the air in Dog-Pose Split , but have
your left foot several inches further away from your hands than in a
usual Dog Pose. This will increase your strength when you come into
the Plank position in step 2. As you inhale, reach your right leg out
wide to the right side. You will need to activate the stabilizing muscles
of your left buttock strongly, to prevent swaying too much to the left
side.

2 .  As you begin your exhalation, tuck your tailbone under and bring
your pelvis forward and down, to come into a Plank position. Your
shoulders will now sit above your wrists. At the same time, bend your
right knee and draw it across the torso toward your left armpit. Lift
your abdominal muscles up toward the spine to help with this action.

3 .  Still on the same long exhalation, continue the flowing leg
movement by moving your right knee toward your right armpit.
Create a fairly straight line from your left heel to the back of your
head. Ensure there is no hinge at the hips, so that you don’t droop
through the front or lift through the buttocks.

4 .  As you inhale, complete the figure-of-eight movement, reaching
your hips up and back to form an inverted V-position, as you
straighten your right leg back up and away to your starting position,
ready for round two. Complete four or more rounds. Then rest the
knees down, sit up and ease out your wrists by circling them a few
times in each direction. Then practise the second side.

Should your wrists start to ache, ease back and build up your strength over the weeks
and months. Practising a narrow Dog, with feet closer to the hands, is easier on weaker
core muscles. Avoid upside-down poses if you have high blood pressure, a detached
retina or a risk of glaucoma.

Work to your comfort level and consult a professional if you have any existing
complaints or discomfort through the movements.

There are nearly as many Sun Salute variations in the world as
there are yoga teachers, and it’s fun getting creative with these
flowing movements. While you may prefer to stick faithfully to
the routines, you can change it up too, using your Sun Salutes
as a springboard to launch into your favourite standing poses.
Go with your mood as you practise. You can choose to work
slowly, feeling your way into each position over the course of
several breaths. Alternatively, you can develop your rhythmic
flow, by performing one movement on each inhalation and
exhalation, to create a moving meditation.
Each of the following Salutes has a different flavour. I hope
you will find one that suits they way you’re feeling – not only
today, but on any given day.

1 .  Kneel and lower your hips to come into the Child Pose . Reach
your arms forward, palms down, and rest your forehead on or just
above the floor.

2 .  Rise up to a kneeling Plank position, with your shoulders over your
wrists. This first time, move your knees back, to create a straight line
from shoulders to knees. Lift your feet so that your toes point
forward.

3 .  Create a small roll-back with your shoulders, to broaden across
your collar bones. Then exhale and bend your elbows backward while
you lower your torso down. There are three important moves here.
The first is to magnetize your shoulder blades toward each other. If
you start to roll your shoulders in, don’t drop any lower, even if you
have only lowered a tiny bit. Keep practising while your strength
builds. Second, don’t splay your elbows out to the sides. Finally, draw
your abdomen toward your spine. You won’t be lowering all the way
to the floor, but imagine that if you were, your chest would touch
down before your belly.
4 .  Inhale to push back up to the kneeling Plank position. Keep your
abdominal muscles strongly engaged – don’t sag your hips or leave
your belly behind. Check that your shoulders don’t roll in. If they do,
don’t lower so much next time.
5 .  Exhale and, with palms glued to the floor, curve your spine upward
and take your hips back toward your heels. You may not reach all the
way back to the Child Pose, but that doesn’t matter. You are going for
a lovely release along the sides of the torso. If you let your hands
slide back toward your knees, you will lose that stretch. Wait for your
next in-breath to begin the next round, and repeat for five to eight
rounds.

Ask a physiotherapist about weight-bearing, if you have shoulder injuries.

1 .  Stand straight with your feet hip-width apart. Take your palms
together in the prayer position.

2 .  As you take a breath in, reach your arms forward and up
overhead, and enjoy the lift and curve of your upper back.

3 .  On your next exhalation, fold forward from the hips and bring your
hands to the floor. Bend the knees, if you need to.

4 .  On an inhalation, step your right leg back into a lunge.
5 .  As you exhale, step your left leg back to create an inverted V-
shaped Classic Downward-Facing Dog Pose .

6 .  On an inhalation, lower both knees to the floor, and then exhale to
take your hips back toward your heels and come into the Child Pose .
7 .  Look forward and then sweep your chest as low as possible
between your thumbs, before curving your spine into a Cobra shape.

8 .  Take your gaze forward and draw your navel toward your spine to
engage your core muscles. Then exhale and lift your hips back up to
a Downward Facing Dog. If you have a tender lower back, bend the
knees as you make this transition.
9 .  Look forward and lift your right wrist. While inhaling, step your right
leg forward between your hands. Take an extra little hop or two
forward, if you don’t get all the way the first time.

1 0 .  Exhale to bring your left foot to meet the right as you fold deeply
inward.

1 1 .  Inhale, contract your core muscles and sweep your arms forward
as you stand up, palms meeting overhead. Bend the knees, if your
back needs more support.

1 2 .  Exhale and lower your prayer-like palms to your chest. Inhale,
ready to sweep the arms out to begin the next round, alternating
sides so that this time your left leg steps back, then forward.
Complete three to four rounds on each side.

1 .  Stand with your big toes touching and your palms together at the
centre of your chest.

2 .  Drop your hands by your sides, then inhale and, with palms turned
upward, reach out through the fingertips to float your arms out and
up. Gaze up and lift your chestbone.

3 .  Exhale and fold forward from the hips. As you do so, turn your
palms out and sweep your arms wide, to bring your fingertips to the
floor in front of your toes. Bend your knees, if you can’t quite reach.

4 .  Inhale and flatten your spine as you gaze slightly forward. (If you
can’t create that hammock shape in your back, bend your knees and
run your fingers up to your knees until you feel your back-muscles
engage. With bent knees, return your hands to the floor, ready for
the next step.)

5 .  Exhale and, with palms flat to the floor, jump, step or walk both
feet back, to create a Plank shape.
6 .  Still on the same exhalation, bend your elbows so they touch your
sides, and lower your torso down to hover just above the floor.

7 .  Engage your abdominal muscles as you inhale, and roll over your
toes to shift your torso forward and up into a backbend for an
Upward-Facing Dog. Roll your shoulders back and down. Keep your
core and the muscles on the fronts of your thighs engaged.
8 .  Exhale as you roll backward over your toes (or tuck them under,
one foot at a time) and lift your hips to come into a Classic
Downward-Facing Dog Pose . Take five slow, deep breaths here.

9 .  After an exhale, look forward to where you want your feet to land
and, with empty lungs, jump (or step) your feet between your hands.
Inhale and lift your shoulders to arch the spine into a backbend
shape. Broaden across your collar bones. As in step 4, bend the
knees and adjust the hand position, if you need to.

1 0 .  Exhale to fold the two halves of your body as close together as
feels good.

1 1 .  Engage your abdominals, and inhale as you move your hips
forward a little and lift to standing, with your palms reaching tall.

1 2 .  Exhale to return to the start, ready to repeat five or more rounds.
m o v e  f o r w a r d
Each time you find yourself in Classic Downward-Facing Dog Pose , lunge one leg
forward to complete the standing pose of your choice. Once complete, step your front
leg to the back, to resume your Sun Salute flow.
t a k e  c a r e
To protect a weak back, ensure that your abdominals are engaged as you transition in
and out of both Downward-Facing Dog and Upward-Facing Dog. Bend your knees as
you move in and out of Downward-Facing Dog. If your shoulders need extra care, lower
the knees to the floor in the Plank position, lower your legs and hips to the floor during
Upward Dog, and don’t hold for too long in Downward Dog.

5 .  Exhale and twist to the left. Inhale, returning to centre. Exhale and
twist to the right. Then inhale to the middle again.

6 .  Exhale and drop your left arm down as you side-bend. Inhale to
the centre. Exhale to reach your left arm up as you curve to the right
side, then inhale up again.

7 .  Tuck your back toes under. Inhale and sweep both hands forward
and up. Continue to circle your right hand backward until it reaches
the right heel. Exhale and use the reach of your left arm to lift the
heart and support the backbend.
8 .  Inhale to reach both arms up in the air. Then move your front leg
back to a high kneeling position.

9 .  Exhale to return the prayer to the heart and sit down on your
heels.
1 0 .  You have done half of one round. Now practise on the second
side, then work with alternate sides for a total of four to six rounds.

Standing poses are brilliant, because even a single standing
pose tends to offer you so many different openings. These are
perfect positions for time-poor modern yogis, as they tick so
many of the boxes that explain why people come to yoga.
They give you strength. They give you flexibility. Within the
standing-posture group you will meet all kinds of movements to
keep you feeling loose, limber and free.
These poses offer twists, side-stretches, backbends,
forward bends, balance work, core activation, hip stretches
and shoulder releases. They will help you to “stand your
ground” as you develop strength and stamina in your legs.
They will teach you about reaching for the stars as you learn to
radiate your limbs out and up. So what are you waiting for?
Enjoy your journey with these multifaceted postures.

1 .  Stand with your feet hip-width apart. Check your feet position and
make sure that both second toes are pointing forward. With your
arms by your side, allow the shoulders to just fall away from the ears.
This is the Mountain Pose.

2 .  Inhale as you take your arms out to the sides and reach them up.
Finish with your palms overhead, shoulder-width apart and facing
forward.

3 .  Now exhale as you bend your knees to take your hips back and
down, as if you were about to sit on a chair, but decided to hover
over it instead. While your knees will move forward as they bend,
minimize this by ensuring that you are taking plenty of weight through
your heels. You may even feel your toes wanting to lift up, but keep
them anchored. These movements will strengthen the fronts of your
thighs. At the same time, bend your elbows wide as you lower them.
Ease your upper-arm bones backward until you feel your upper-back
muscles working. Inhale to return to step 2, with your straight arms
reaching overhead. Exhale and lower your arms to return to the
Mountain Pose. Inhale to begin the next round and repeat for five to
eight rounds in total.

1 .  From standing, step your right foot forward about 1.2–1.5m (4–
5ft). With your left heel lifted, bend your right knee to 90 degrees, so
that you are in a high lunge. Reach your arms up overhead and cup
the elbows in the palm of your hands. Next, create a tucking-under
action with your tailbone to increase the stretch in the front of your
left hip. Reinforce your back knee lift, so that it doesn’t sag, while you
maintain this pelvic tucking-under action. Now finesse this a bit:
starting from just above the hips, lift up through the sides of your
torso so that your forearms move away from the crown of the head.
As you do this, anchor the shoulder blades downward so that the
shoulders don’t hunch, but everything else will have a sense of
squeezing upward. While your upper body continues to lift, create
your anchoring with the lower half of your body: from your hips,
extend back and out strongly through the left heel. By increasing the
distance between the back heel and both elbows, you will create a
delicious feeling of length.

2 .  On an exhalation, plug in your abdominals by drawing your navel
toward your spine, and lean your torso forward. Let the strong sheets
of muscles over your back activate, keeping your back feeling flat
and strong. Do not drop your arms – hold your upper arms level with
your ears. Inhale and return to the first position, then set up your flow
by moving with each part of your breath: inhaling upright, and
exhaling to lower. Repeat for five to ten rounds.

3 .  Now build your stamina and strength by strategically increasing the
load on your upper-back muscles. Hold your forward tilt and
straighten your arms, with palms facing each other, shoulder-width
apart. Hold still in this position for five to ten breaths. Reinforce the
posterior pelvic-tucking-under action and work through the points in
step 2 to enhance the posture. Then change legs and complete the
second side.

1 .  Stand with your feet together and your palms touching, in prayer.
On an exhale, come into a squat. Inhale and lift your chestbone to
touch your thumbs. Now exhale and twist to the right, and lodge your
left elbow close to your outer right knee. If you can’t lock your elbow
in place, bring your torso up a little higher, take your left hand to your
outer right knee and place your right hand on your right hip instead.
Tuck your chin in slightly and look up. If your palms are together,
bring the elbows to a 90-degree bend, if possible, so that your hands
move closer to your hip. You can then “drive” your right palm
downward while you resist with the left. This will rotate your torso
further into the twist. Stay for several long breaths, then progress to
the lunge.

2 .  Looking down, lift your left heel. If you can, lift the whole foot to
hover in the air. Send your leg back to take a long, deep lunge
position. Continue pressing the palms together to allow the torso to
twist deeply.

3 .  If you can, bring the shoulders into play. Lean further forward and
lower your left shoulder to lock against your right outer knee. Bending
at the elbow, rotate your left palm backward, then slide the back of
the hand under your right thigh. Reach your right arm up to vertical,
and turn from the shoulder so that the thumb points downward. Bring
that arm down past the lower back and catch the fingers or grasp the
right wrist. Looking up, deepen the twist by attempting to straighten
your elbows. Reach your knuckles away so that your hands no longer
touch your body. Stay for five breaths, then repeat on the second
side.

1 .  Step your feet about 1.2m (4ft apart). Turn your left foot out so
that the toes point away from your body and move your right foot so
that it points inward by about 15 degrees. Now take your arms up to
join the palms overhead. Create a nice feeling in the shoulders by
broadening across your upper back and moving the outer edges of
your armpits slightly toward each other. Press down actively into the
floor with your feet. Lift your kneecaps by pulling them up with your
front thigh muscles, so that the legs feel super-strong and steady.
Enhance the lift upward by elevating your ribcage away from your
hips. Next, reach your elbows higher up in the air, then lengthen all
the way through to your fingertips. Exhale as you turn your palms
outward and widen your arms to horizontal. At the same time, bend
your left knee, bringing your thigh bone to horizontal, or as close to
that as is manageable. Adjust your foot spacing as needed on this
first round. Anchor through your back foot and keep your back leg
feeling active. Check your front knee tracks over your second toe
and that your knee is above – and not in front of – your left ankle.

2 .  Once you have set up your spacing and alignment, it’s time for the
fun flow. Inhale, straighten your front leg as your palms reach
overhead together. In this position you can imagine your lungs being
stretched lengthways. Exhale as you bend your front knee and widen
your arms out, using the arm movement to help the lungs empty fully.
Continue inhaling up and exhaling wide for ten or more rounds. Then
work on side two.

1 .  Take a Warrior II position by stepping your feet 1.2–1.5m (4–5ft)
apart. Turn your right leg and foot inward by 15 degrees. Turn your
left toes out by 90 degrees and bend your left knee to sit it above
your left ankle. Ensure your left knee doesn’t sag inward, and that it
staysin line with the second toe. Keep your right leg super-straight.
Think of lifting the inner arch of your right foot, and feel a current of
energy run up the underside of the leg and thigh, creating a lifting
action. Take your arms to horizontal, palms facing forward so that
your thumbs point up. Keep your right leg super-straight. Think of

2 .  As you exhale, bend your elbows to float your palms closer
together in front of your chest. Curl your fingers and soften your
palms to cup an imaginary golden ball. Let your next inhalation carry
your arms wide and back out to the side, as in step 1. Imagine the
vacuum in your lungs, easily sucking in this fresh air so that your
lungs broaden. Then exhale again and visualize your lungs narrowing
as the elbows close in. Continue for ten breaths or more. Enjoy the
feeling of broadening and then narrowing your lungs, as the air
moves in and out of them. Keep your legs working strongly so that
your lower body position doesn’t alter at all. Experience your base as
strong and stable, while your torso, shoulders, arms and breath feel
soft and floaty.

1 .  Stand with your legs wide apart. Go for about 1.3m (4½ft), or a
little further if you are tall or have the flexibility. Turn your left foot out
by 90 degrees and then, revolving from the right hip, allow the right
leg and foot to turn in by 15 degrees. Bend your left knee to 90
degrees. Take your arms to horizontal. Look back to ensure your
right shoulder isn’t lifted, yet reinforce the muscular action along your
back arm, so that it doesn’t droop. Then settle your gaze on your left
middle fingernail. This is your Warrior II pose.

2 .  To come into your Side-Angle Stretch, extend from your left hip to
reach your left arm out and away. Bring your fingertips or flat palm to
the floor near your left big toe. Press your left arm into your left leg,
to help ease the knee backward a little, which will keep it tracking
over your second toe. As you do this, take your right arm up and
over, so that the upper arm sits just above your right ear, palm facing
down. Create a strong line of energy by reaching from your right foot
all the way to your right fingertips.

3 .  Now come into Exultant Warrior. Press down through your left foot
as you raise your torso upright and slide your right hand down your
right leg. Be sure not to move the front knee – keep it bent and
magnetized to the left. As you do these movements, work the left
arm, too. Revolving from the shoulder to open your left palm to the
sky, take the arm up and overhead, to encourage the left side of your
torso into a long, luscious curve. Stay and breathe here. Feel
yourself taking the air into your left lung, almost as if the air were
bypassing the nose and you were breathing directly in through your
left-side ribs, like a fish breathing.
4 .  Now that your body has soaked up the correct alignment, you can
speed things up to enjoy the flow. Inhale as your arms come to
horizontal, returning to Warrior II as in step 1. Let the exhale take
your reach out and down to Side-Angle Stretch as in step 2. On your
next inhale, return to Warrior II, then exhale up and over to Exultant
Warrior. After five or ten rounds, enjoy the second side.

1 .  Start with your feet 1.2m (4ft) apart. Turn your left foot out by 90
degrees and turn your right leg and foot in by 15 degrees. Bend your
left knee to sit directly above the left ankle. Rest your left elbow on
your left thigh. Because the thrust of this movement will be to the left
and forward, you need to develop a strong anchoring of your back
leg. Look back at your right foot and press down through its little-toe
edge. As you do this, lift the inner arch of the right foot slightly. You
may experience a subtle lift of the inner knee and thigh away from
the floor. Take your left foot wider and continue to ease your left knee
forward, aiming to have it bent to 90 degrees. Once you have got
your legs generously wide, bring in the shoulder action. Check that
you feel safe and that your legs feel stable. There must be no sense
of “losing” the grounding on the back foot or the lifting action along
the back leg, because they provide a vital anchor.
Interlace your fingers behind your back. Turn your belly and chest
toward the ground and lower your whole torso to the floor. Bowing the
head down, take your arms up and over. Let the reaching away with
your knuckles lift your shoulders away from your ears. If you feel you
want to take the legs wider, do so safely – take your fingertips to the
floor first, to steady yourself. Reposition your legs, check that the
back leg in particular is strongly rooted, then bring the arms back into
your final pose.

1 .  Start with your feet about 1.2m (4ft) apart. Turn your left knee and
toes out by 90 degrees and your right thigh and foot inward by 15
degrees. Bring your left hand to your left knee. Tilt forward, letting
your bottom move back. Take your right arm out to the right. Rotating
from your shoulder, turn your right thumb down so that your palm
faces back. Then slide the back of your hand across the lower back
and hook the fingers to your left inner thigh. Grasp your right wrist
with the left hand to help bring your hand lower. If you can’t reach
your thigh, hold the back of your waistband.

2 .  Once your fingers are hooked on, you can bring your posture into
a pure alignment. Straighten your left knee as you move your hips
forward and ease both shoulders backward. The two shoulders will
line up over your left knee and ankle. While your left hip will be on the
same plane as your left knee, do allow your right hip to be 5–7.5cm
(2–3in) forward of the left. Choose a neck position that suits you,
looking up, forward or down. Hold here and breathe. A small extra
roll-back of the top shoulder can feel amazing.

3 .  Now release the arm and fly into a classic Triangle Pose. Keeping
your legs and torso just where they were, extend your right arm to
vertical and enjoy a new freedom in the shoulder. After several
breaths, come out and practise side two.

1 .  Stand with your feet about 1.3–1.6m (4½–5¼ft) apart. Turn your
left foot out by 90 degrees and turn your right thigh, knee and foot in
by 15 degrees. Bend your left knee as close as you can get to 90
degrees. Take your left elbow to your left thigh. When you are ready,
lean down to drop your left arm in front of your knee. Next, drop your
shoulder even lower, to below the inner left knee. Now, rotate inward
from the left shoulder and take your left hand under the left thigh.
Keep taking the hand back, reaching toward the sacrum. With the
lower arm in position, reach your right arm up and rotate from the
shoulder to turn the palm backward, thumb pointing down.

2 .  Now bend your right elbow and slide the back of the right hand
across the lower back. If you can, curl the right and left fingertips
together or, better still, hold your right wrist with your left hand. If you
can’t hold hands, grasp your clothing instead. Roll your top shoulder
strongly back, then rotate your torso to the right and up. If that’s
comfortable for your neck, look up. If you are holding hands, try
straightening both elbows and reaching your hands away, so that
your hands are clear of your body. Create a steady breathing rhythm.

3 .  Move slowly to straighten your left leg for the amazing hamstring
stretch. Deepen your pose by working again through the points in
step 2. Hold for four to ten breaths before coming out, ready for the
second side.

1 .  Stand with your legs wide apart. Position your feet so that their
outer edges are parallel – your big toes will be closer together than
your inner heels. Bend your knees and fold upside-down. If you have
space, let your arms dangle, or if you are closer to the floor, fold your
forearms to let them hang. You want everything from your hips down
to your head, elbows and fingers to be soft and floppy. Check that
your shoulders feel soft. Gently nod or a shake the head to release
the neck. Stay in this position, and enjoy soft belly-breathing while
you allow the weight of your head to ease your spine longer and
flatter. This pose is about passively letting go and surrendering to
gravity. If you don’t feel you can open up to this sensation, bend your
knees a lot more, which will help your torso to flatten, giving the
sensation of sending your ribs through your inner thighs. This will
help to create the feeling of dangling that you need in order to
release and enjoy the pose. Visualize each of your vertebrae as a
perfect pearl, strung together to form a beautiful long necklace.

2 .  Now set up a slow sideways swish with the pearl necklace of your
spine. Shift your hips to the right and let your torso sway right, then
swish everything to the left. Be like seaweed on the ocean floor,
responding to the slow tidal currents. Let it be slow, so that you can
really enjoy it. As you move from side to side, let the elbow nearest
the middle squeeze away from its hip and ease it closer to the floor.
Enjoy the inner-thigh stretch as you sway. Continue to remind your
neck muscles to let go, and allow the passive weight of your head,
like a nice round coconut, to help the whole of your spine lengthen
out.

1 .  From standing, measure out your foot spacing by putting a fist
between your big toes. This is the anatomical hip-width apart position
for your feet. Take a yoga strap (or any soft belt, such as a bathrobe
tie) and hold it between your hands behind your back. Hold the strap
so that your hands are about 10cm (4in) apart. If you don’t have a
belt handy, interlace your fingers behind your back. Roll your
shoulders back to broaden across your collar bones. Send a current
of energy out through the arms and elbows as you reach your hands
away from the shoulders, and then lift your hands as high up and far
back as possible. Move your knuckles and chestbone away from
each other.

2 .  Fold forward from the hips. Choose whether you want your legs
straight, to develop your hamstring stretch, or bent, so that you can
focus on your shoulders. Once you are upside-down, continue to
reach your hands away from your shoulders. If you are using a belt,
pull on it, as if to separate your hands. You may feel a pleasant
releasing sensation in the shoulders, as if you are making more
space in the shoulder joints.

3 .  Now commence rolling first one shoulder forward, and then the
other, as if you were practising freestyle swimming. After five or ten
rolls, “swim” backstroke with each shoulder in turn. Enjoy the way the
circular action softens the shoulders. Return to symmetry and again
give a slow traction on the belt, to work deeper into the shoulders.
Then bend the knees and stand up, and feel your shoulders smile at
you.

1 .  With your right leg in front, stand with your feet 1m (3¼ft) apart.
While your front foot points forward, have your back foot turned out
by 15 degrees. Square your hips to the front and take your arms out
wide. Roll the shoulders forward as you turn your thumbs down and
bend the elbows, to bring the palms together behind your back.
Wiggle your palms higher up your back. Revolve your abdomen to
the right a little, then fold from the hips into Intense Forward Stretch.
Anchor through the back foot and move your right hip forward. Hold
for five breaths.

2 .  Flow into Revolved Triangle Pose. Leave your right hand in
position and take your left hand to the floor, by the big toe. If you
need to, bend your knee to reduce any rounding of the spine. That
lovely long feeling through your spine will improve your twisting
action. It’s nice to press the left hand into your back, to “push” you
into the twist. Stack your shoulders by moving your left shoulder to
the right and your right shoulder up and back. If you can, move your
left hand to the little-toe edge of the foot. If it’s comfortable, look up.
Breathe for five long breaths.

3 .  Now move into Revolved Half-Moon Flow. Look down and move
your left hand about 30cm (12in) forward and a little to the right of
the big toe. Take a small step forward with your back foot, coming
onto the back toes. Lift your back leg up to horizontal. Lower your
right hip, yet maintain a strong lift with the left thigh and knee, to
prevent the foot drooping lower than the hip. Now “free” your right
arm by flying it up to vertical. Further develop the twist in the torso,
and again aim to stack the shoulders by moving the left shoulder
further to the right and the right shoulder to the left. Hold for five
breaths. Then move through the Classic Downward-Facing Dog Pose
and practise side two.

B A L A N C I N G  B A L M S
Balancing postures tone. They stretch, they strengthen. But
when my students ask for them in class, it’s usually because
they want to calm a scattered mind. It’s simple: the more
speedily we race through our modern lives, the more we crave
those moments where we stop, stand still and take stock.
Finding your bodily balance spills over to the psycho-emotional
realm, too – a balance pose can feel as if it’s bringing you
closer to your calm centre. Balances naturally draw the
wandering mind inward. And the focus required to balance
relieves stress, as you need to mentally return to the present
moment.
A bit of balance-prowess makes injuries from falling later in
life less likely, so these postures are yoga life insurance for the
years ahead. You can relax, smiling, into those little wobbles,
knowing that your nervous and muscular systems are
masterfully fine-tuning with your adjustments and micro-
adjustments. You will experience how any tiny alteration in a
single part of your body will mean that all the other parts subtly
shift to accommodate this change. This creates a beautiful
sense of harmony throughout your whole body, and you will

Life just feels better when we are fluid and stable, so enjoy
developing these patterns in finding your balance on the mat,
and in balancing your life off the mat.

1 .  Come into your basic Tree Pose: from standing, ground down
through the right foot and bend your left knee up. Take hold of your
left ankle, and position your foot as high up your right inner thigh as
possible while avoiding the knee joint. The lower the foot is, the
easier it is to balance. Press the sole of your foot against your inner
thigh, while at the same time resisting back with the inner thigh
toward the sole of the foot. This will keep you feeling more stable.
Touch your thumbs to your index fingers and take your arms up to
the sides, elbows bent and palms facing up.

2 .  Now curve your Tree. Tilt your torso over to the left, so that your
left elbow moves closer to the left knee. Keep your elbow “branches”
wide and back, and sigh your shoulders away from your ears.
Maintain a light and regular breathing rhythm as you hold for five to
ten breaths.

3 .  Come upright and make your Twisty Tree. First twist to your right,
away from your bent knee. Firm your abdominal muscles to help you
revolve as deeply as possible. Notice how your breathing changes.
After several breaths, return to the centre and revolve to your left.
This might feel more satisfying, as you can go further. Again, it’s your
core muscles that will pull you around most obviously, but do
appreciate the working of the back muscles, too. After several
breaths, return to the centre. Come back onto two feet, re-centre
and practise side two.

1 .  From standing, bend both knees. Lift your left knee up and take it
across your right thigh. If you can, wrap your leg all the way around,
so that your left ankle locks behind your right calf. If that movement
isn’t possible for you, take your left ankle to your right thigh, just near
the knee. Once you have found your leg position, bend your standing
leg deeply and tilt forward from the hips, to get more release in the
gluteal muscles. Extend your arms out wide and begin to travel your
left arm down and your right arm up. As you come toward vertical
with each arm, bend the elbows to bring your hands together behind
your back. Hook the fingers together. If your hands can’t reach each
other, get as close as you can for today – time and practice will take
care of that, so smile that you are here now, patiently enjoying the
journey as tensions dissolve.

2 .  Once this movement is complete, switch your arms to the second
side. Release your finger grasp, and straighten both elbows. Inhale to
circle both arms long and wide, as your left arm floats up while your
right arm sinks. Exhale as both elbows bend and the fingers reclaim
their grasp. Don’t be surprised if one side feels stiffer than the other
– I tell my students it just means they are a human being who has
lived. Accept your asymmetries, smile kindly upon yourself and keep
practising.

3 .  Stay balancing on one leg as you continue to move in time with
your breath. Inhale as you circle to reach your arms vertically up and
down, then exhale to bend and clasp. Set up a slow flow, alternating
from side to side, while your shoulders soften in their acceptance of
the stretches. After about eight rounds, come back to standing on
two feet. Take some time to note where your body has released.

1 .  Stand with your left foot forward and your right foot back, and both
feet about 1.2m (4ft) apart. Turn your back foot out by about 15
degrees. Bend your front knee to a right-angle (or as close as you
can) to come into a lunge. Now interlace your fingers behind your
back. Roll your shoulders strongly back, and wrinkle up the skin
between your shoulder blades. Lift your arms and hands as high as
possible and ensure your elbows are really straight. Elevate your
ribcage away from your waist and, in particular, lift up through your
chestbone to create a glorious backbend shape. This is a classic
Warrior I posture, with a great shoulder variation to work on tight
shoulders.

2 .  Take a small step forward with your back foot, coming up to
tiptoes. Lean your torso forward slightly, so that you come out of the
backbend. Contract your abdominal muscles, creating a muscular
connection between your lowest ribs in front and your hip bones. This
will help enormously during your one-legged balancing. Tilt forward
some more, as you lift your back leg all the way up to horizontal.
Your right hip will probably have lifted, compared to your left, so drop
it down so that you are flat across your sacrum. In Flying Warrior,
continue to reach your knuckles away with energy to stretch the
fronts of both shoulders.

3 .  If you can, take this pose upside-down. Squeeze on your
abdominals and, lengthening out from the tailbone, tilt forward at the
hips. If you don’t travel far, bend your standing leg to go further. On
your flying leg, squeeze on the muscles of the front thigh to reach it
further up and away. Fan out the toes of the right foot. Reach your
arms up and over as far as they will go. Be like a bicycle wheel –
from the centre of your pelvis, radiate your “spokes” out and away
strongly in three directions: up and over with the arms, grounding
down with the standing leg, and up and away with the flying leg. Stay
for five breaths and then, with control, return to step 1. Bring your
feet together and change sides.

It’s always possible to practise one-legged standing poses on two legs while you
develop your balancing skills. Keep your back big toe on the floor to help, while still
focusing your weight-bearing on the front leg. Avoid inversions during menstruation and
if you have eye issues, such as a detached retina or a risk of glaucoma. Seek advice
before practising one-legged poses if you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells.

1 .  Start with your feet hip-width apart. Fold forward and bend the
knees enough to enable your ribs to drop closer to your thighs, so
that your vertebral column feels as if it is dangling. With your
fingertips to the floor, release the neck and shoulder muscles to allow
the head to hang, pleasantly heavy. Relax into this for several long
breaths, letting gravity do its work.

2 .  Next, transfer your weight onto your left foot and left hand. Start to
lift your right leg and arm up and out to the side. Keep these two
limbs soft, to create a sense of unfurling as you open up and out to
the side.

3 .  Now come into a classic Half-Moon Pose. Float your right arm and
straighten it, reaching it up to vertical. Then press your right heel
away, pressing actively through your right leg and foot. Straighten
your standing leg as much as your inner-thigh flexibility will allow.
Some people enjoy making a T-shape, with their torso and leg on a
horizontal plane. Others like to lift the right leg higher, to allow the
torso to drop down, as shown. Stay there for five breaths.

4 .  To transition to Sugar-Cane Goddess Pose, bend your right knee
in toward your abdomen. Catch your foot with your right hand. Then
open through the front of the hip and send the knee back and away.
Press your right heel to your right buttock. Anchoring through your
left fingertips, rotate your torso to the right and upward. Moving from
your belly will create a spiralling sensation. After five to ten breaths,
return to the soft forward fold (step 1), and then practise side two.

1 .  Start with your legs wide apart with your left foot in front. Turn your
left foot out to 45 degrees and turn your right leg and foot in a little.
Fold over to bring your fingers to the floor. Walk your fingertips to
your left, bringing one hand on each side of the foot. Bend into your
left knee and come up onto your fingertips, to give the torso
clearance for the next move. As you inhale first lift the chest up, then
twist your belly strongly to the left, to line up your chestbone with
your left thigh bone. Then, when you exhale, you can lay your chest
on your thigh, possibly straightening that leg to warm up for the
stronger hamstring stretch that is coming.
Bend your left knee again and move your right fingertips about 30cm
(12in) in front of your big toe, keeping your hand to the right of the
foot. Wrap your left forearm against your left calf, elbow bent, so that
your forearm is vertical and your hand wraps above the heel. Take a
small step in with the back foot and come onto your right toes, ready
for lift-off.

2 .  Transfer your weight to your left foot and lift up the right leg. Press
the leg up and away, while you balance on your left leg and right
hand. Now seek to close the gap between your torso and left thigh. If
possible, straighten your standing leg. Increase the challenge by
walking your right fingertips back to come level with your left toes.
Ensure both legs are super-straight and send that flying leg up to
vertical. Squeeze the muscles of the front thigh, to help lift it even
more. If you can, instead of looking down, untuck your chin and look
across on the horizontal. Keep working to “glue” your belly and chest
to your thigh. And last but not least, breathe! After five or more
breaths, come down lightly and with control. Walk your hands across
to the right and adjust your feet, ready for side two.

3 .  If you really want to go for it, with an increased twisting action plus
a strong shoulder stretch, change the arm position in step 2. Wrap
your right arm on the outside of your left leg, by crossing your right
shoulder over the front of the left shin.

1 .  From standing, extend your right leg back, touching your toes to
the floor behind you. Square your hips to the front. Bend the right
knee, and reach back with your right hand to catch the foot. Notice
how your ribcage has lost its symmetry, and reinforce the forward
propulsion through the right side to square it off with the left as much
as possible. As you reach the right foot up and back to create your
Dancer’s pose, tip your torso forward. Reach your left arm out in
front, palm up. Place the tips of your thumb and index-finger
together. Each time you practise Dancer’s Bow you can alternate
between having your standing leg bent or, as shown, straight.
Remind yourself that good balancing doesn’t mean holding a shape
perfectly still. Invite in the tiny movements and micro-adjustments as
you find and refine your centre. Hold for five breaths.

2 .  Now prepare to take this posture upside-down. Be ready to bend
your standing knee at any time over these next moments. While you
press your raised foot up and away, fold upside-down to take your
left hand to the floor. If you can’t reach, bend your knee, or place a
yoga brick under your left hand. Stay for five breaths and then, with
mindfulness and control, inhale to come up, bending the knee as you
need to. Change sides.

1 .  Stand with your feet together in Mountain Pose. Bring your palms
together at your heart centre in the middle of your chest. Enjoy the
length in your spine and notice its natural curves.

2 .  Lift up onto tiptoe and feel your abdominal muscles activate. As
you prepare to bend your knees and lower down, do your best to
resist the urge to tilt the torso forward. Instead, as you lower your
hips to your lifted heels in a low squat, move as if you were in an
elevator, keeping your spine as vertical as possible.

3 .  Place your hands to the floor to steady yourself and extend your
left leg straight out, heel to the floor. Lean forward and then reach out
your left hand to loop your big toe with your first two fingers. If you
can’t reach, grasp a soft belt looped around the ball of the foot.

4 .  Lift your left leg in the air as you counterbalance by dropping the
right heel down to the floor. Bring your torso to an upright position
and activate the muscles of your whole back. Squeezing on the
muscles of the upper back will uncurve the spine, so you can then lift
as tall as possible. Hold your right hand in a classic yoga hand-
gesture called Jnana Mudra, with the tips of thumb and index finger
touching. Allow the elbow to bend down and the palm to face up.
Stay there for five to ten breaths. Then release your foot and slide it
back in, so the feet come together. With your palms together, lift your
hips to come up to Mountain Pose, then lift back up onto tiptoes,
ready for the other side.

Two things most commonly requested by students in a yoga
class are relief for a tight neck and quality shoulder-openers. In
this section you will find both, and there are more such
exercises scattered throughout the book. Some of these
postures link the whole body, and others you can bring into
your day off the mat – poses that you can practise at your
desk and sneak into those spare moments.
So if you find that your neck and shoulders seem to be a
reservoir for stress, make peace with those tight muscles and
give your neck and shoulders the yoga-love they have been
craving.

1 .  Stand side-on to the wall, with the wall to your left. Position your
left foot about 15cm (6in) from the wall. Have your feet hip-width
apart, with both sets of toes pointing straight ahead. Get the
maximum stretch possible by coming up onto tiptoes to take your left
palm as high up the wall as possible. With your palm pressed firmly
to the wall, over several long exhalations, slowly lower your heels to
the floor. Imagine your left palm is glued to the wall and resist sliding
it down while you lower your heels. Trust in the releasing ability of
your exhalations to allow the soft tissues of your whole body to
lengthen, so that you can do your best stretch through your shoulder
and down your torso. Now add in a stretch for the left side of your
neck. Lightly tuck in your chin and revolve your head to look down
the front of your right shoulder. Hinge your right wrist, to press out
through the heel of that hand. As you do this, aim to keep each hip
sitting over each ankle below, so that you resist leaning toward the
wall. After several breaths here, return your head and neck to a
forward-looking position.

2 .  From the vertical left-arm position, like 12 o’clock, move your left
arm back a few notches, to half-past ten on your imaginary clock
face. Stretch the skin and fingers of your left hand and reach it as far
back as possible. Without moving your left hand at all, lean your body
forward, to increase the shoulder and chest-muscle stretch. Stay
here for eight or more breaths, allowing the front of your shoulder to
release deeply.

3 .  Finally, move your hand to half-past nine on the clock. With palm
glued to the wall, lean your torso forward as you enjoy this effective
release for the shoulders. After eight or more breaths, come out and
let both arms hang by your sides. Notice how thoroughly different
your two shoulders feel. Most likely the one you have stretched will
feel warm, loose, vibrant and alive. Your other shoulder deserves to
feel this good, too, so turn around and work with the second side
using the clock positions of 12 o’clock, half-past two and half-past
three.

1 .  Stand with your feet hip-width apart. Spread both arms out wide,
then bring them toward each other in front. As they come together in
front, drop your right elbow down and slip it across, up and around to
the left of your left upper arm. Then, if you can manage it, cross over
at the forearms as well, to bring the right fingers to touch the left
palm.

2 .  Keeping your arms intertwined, draw circles with your elbows.
Move in a clockwise direction. Go as wide as you can to each side,
and get plenty of height for your circle, too. Allow your shoulders to
dance a little, and notice how your torso twists to respond to the
movement.

3 .  Once your shoulders have accepted the stretch, expand the
movement out to involve your whole torso. Tip forward from the hips
and circle your entire body in a clockwise direction as well.

4 .  After five rounds of these big circles, come back to standing tall.
Unravel your arms and let them dangle. Take time to note where your
body has released. Then inhale to widen your arms to horizontal.
Exhale and entwine them again, this time with the left arm under the
right. Circle anticlockwise, before adding in the larger movements of
the torso.

1 .  Sit or kneel in any comfortable position that allows your spine to
feel tall. Imagine you have a ripe peach between your chin and chest.
Most likely your chin will tuck in, but don’t overdo it and bruise the
fruit – you want to enjoy the natural inward curve of your neck. Take
one palm to your forehead. Set up a light pressure of your forehead
against it. Resist with your palm just enough to ensure that you don’t
travel anywhere. Hold for three breaths, before resting and repeating.

2 .  Now interlace both hands behind your head. Again, ensure you
maintain the natural curve of those precious neck vertebrae, but drop
the chin down subtly, which will activate some important stabilizers –
the deep neck flexor muscles. Press your head back into your hands,
while resisting with the hands so that no outward movement occurs.
Hold for three breaths. Rest and repeat. Then, with a light pressure
from the hands, drop your chin to your throat for a gentle neck
stretch, over three or four breaths.

3 .  Now do the same for the muscles on the side of the neck. Place
one palm against your ear. With your head in a neutral position, press
your head and palm against each other while staying still. After three
breaths, rest and repeat. Then move on to side two.

4 .  Finally, combine a lateral neck stretch with some strength work. Tilt
your head to the right and reach your right arm up overhead, to place
your right fingers over your left ear. Press down with your palm, yet
resist upward with your head for three breaths. Then let go of the
resistance, as the light palm pressure offers you a stretch all the way
down the side of the neck to the tip of the left shoulder. After three
breaths, lower your arm and bring your head upright, ready for side
two.

1 .  Kneel in the Hero Pose, as shown, or take any seated position
where your spine can float tall. Take both arms behind your back.
Interlace your fingers, and then pull both hands around to the right
side of your waist. Take a few mindful, yet firm pulls, to ease both
sets of knuckles forward. You may be able to draw both hands to the
front of your body. If possible, close both wrists toward each other.
Ensure your torso doesn’t twist off to one side, and keep it facing
square-on to the front. Do your best to maintain a neutral spine
position, too, resisting the tendency to move into a backbend shape.
Now roll both shoulders back and squeeze your elbows toward each
other. Stay here for five to ten breaths.

2 .  For the next step, add in a neat little neck release. Turn your head
to look to the right. Draw your chin toward your throat so that your
eyes will look down, then release it so that your eyes look out
horizontal again. Set up a nodding action by repeating the chin tuck-
and-release a few more times. Then return your head to centre, and
bring your arms to your sides. Notice any changes that have
occurred in your neck and shoulders. Then repeat on the second
side.

1 .  In a high kneeling position, reach both arms overhead. Tuck your
tailbone under to bring your hips into a posterior tilt position. Exhale
as you lean back, enjoying a front thigh stretch and a bit of core-
strengthening. Inhale as you return to vertical. Flow together your
backward and forward movements and breaths a few more times.

2 .  The next time you lean back, reach your right arm back while you
take your left arm forward. Circle the arms, so that both reach
downward as you are at your deepest lean backward. As both arms
complete their circles to reach up overhead, your body returns to
vertical. Continue for five or more rounds with the arms circling in this
direction.

3 .  The next time both arms meet overhead, change directions to
circle your arms the opposite way. As you complete five or more
rounds, remind yourself that you are doing this to soften your tight
shoulders. So soften your brain a little, too. Sometimes we over-think
things. Remove all that mental tension of trying too hard – just relax
and have fun.

1 .  Sit on the floor with your legs bent up in front of you. Take your left
arm out to the side and, rotating from the shoulder, turn the palm to
the back so the thumb points down. Bend your elbow and slide the
back of your hand up your back. Cup your left elbow with your right
hand and ease the elbow toward the midline of your body. As you do
this, snuggle your left fingers up your back, as if they were trying to
tickle the back of your neck.

2 .  Once you have drawn your left elbow in as much as possible, hold
it in place and lie yourself down on the floor. Choose your most-
relaxed leg position: you can bend your knees up or lengthen them
out along the floor. Rest your right arm on the floor. Now use your
breathing to get deeper into the stretch. Inhale light and warmth into
your shoulder, and exhale away any tensions. If you sense that your
shoulder can go one step further, roll your left shoulder back to
increase the sensation. Stay here for one or two minutes. Roll to the
right side to come out and sit up. When you practise the second side,
remember that while your body may have tightened up in response to
life’s impacts, it is doing the very best it can for you. Be grateful for
all its good efforts.

1 .  Stand facing a table or similar support. Your right foot should be
about 30cm (12in) from the support, toes pointing forward. Step your
left leg back about 60cm (2ft) and turn your foot out by 15 degrees.
Bend your front knee and fold forward to place your elbows on the
support, shoulder-width apart. Then bring your palms together with
fingers pointing upward. Ease your hips back, so that your back
comes to a flat shape. Position your head so that your ears are
between your upper arms. The more you can move your hips back
and create that long, flat feeling in your spine, the easier it will be for
your head to clear the ledge. If you can, straighten your front knee
and deepen the crease where your right thigh joins your torso. This
will allow your right hip to move backward a little, which will keep the
hips square. Stay here for eight or more breaths.
2 .  If you would like to add to this stretch, bend both elbows and take
your thumbs to the spine between your shoulder blades. Do this on
an exhalation, then inhale to return your forearms up to a vertical
position. Repeat a few more times, exhaling down, then inhaling back
up. Step forward to come up. Then repeat with your left leg in front.

1 .  Sit on the floor with your legs bent up in front. Take your right arm
underneath your right thigh to grasp your left ankle. Pull your left foot
through, to rest on the floor by your right hip. Position your left knee
to the midline of your body, as much as possible. Now take your right
ankle in your left hand. Lift the leg up and over to the left, so that
your right foot rests by your left outer hip. As much as your hips will
allow, stack your right knee on top of your left.

2 .  Open your arms wide and bring them together, dropping your left
elbow under the right one to interlock your upper arms. Entwine them
again at the forearms or wrists, so that your palms face each other.
3 .  Set up a contraction that will work deeply into the back of the
shoulders. Squeeze your right elbow to the right, and resist as you
squeeze your left elbow to the left. As the resistance is equal, you
won’t travel anywhere. Hold for several breaths.
Now do the same sort of thing, only up and down. Press your top
elbow down while pushing up with your lower elbow for several
breaths. Again, with even resistance, you won’t move outwardly, but
you may well feel a good release in the shoulders. Repeat the
horizontal and vertical pressure-squeezes, if you like. Finally, let go of
the contraction work. Lift both elbows higher and straighten them as
much as you can, without losing the upper-arm lock. Mentally direct
your breath into the space between your shoulder blades to help this
area soften and open. Add in a forward fold to awaken the hips. If
you are flexible, aim your elbows beyond your knees. Breathe for five
to ten slow breaths. Then come out and practise side two.

1 .  Start on all fours, with your hands under your shoulders and your
knees under your hips. Walk both hands forward about 30cm (12in),
to come to a kneeling Plank position. The exact distance will depend
on your proportions, so aim to create a straight line from your knees
through your hips to your shoulders. Roll your shoulders back, so
that you broaden across your collar bones. This is an important
action that you will aim to maintain for the whole sequence. Keep
your shoulders nicely set by drawing your shoulder blades together
slightly, as if magnetized. Lift your navel toward your spine. At the
same time, create a sense of drawing your hip bones toward each
other, across the front of the abdomen. Lift your right leg in the air
behind you. Resist the urge to drop the abdomen toward the floor or
to curve more into the lower back.

2 .  Check that the inner creases of both elbows are facing forward,
then bend your elbows so that they brush past the sides of your
waist. Keep your elbows snug into the side of your body, not splayed
wide. Take your torso forward as you lower down, so that your
fingertips will be level with your armpits. Think about going forward,
rather than down to the ground. How much you lower is up to you.
It’s fine to drop just a little in the beginning. At your deepest you will
create right-angles at the wrists and elbows. Straighten your arms to
complete your push-up. Ensure your abdomen doesn’t sag as you lift
up. Check that your shoulders haven’t rolled in, either. If you start to
roll your shoulders in, then you have reached fatigue point and that
means your body has had enough of this practice – work on it
another day instead, and you will build up strength for deeper drops
and more repetitions. Repeat five to ten more push-ups, paying
attention to your form. Rest, and then complete a second set with
your left leg lifted.

3 .  Once you have the strength to maintain good alignment, you can
practise your yoga tricep push-ups with both knees off the floor and
toes tucked under. If you have the strength, hold the low hover, just
off the floor, in the full Crocodile pose.

1 .  From standing, fold forward and place your hands on the floor,
shoulder width apart. Come onto tiptoes and walk your feet closer as
you bend your knees, preparing to wrap them around your upper
arms. You can tuck your knees up towards the armpits, or you may
prefer to place them closer to your elbows. To prepare to bear more
weight, reach your thumbs towards each other and spread your
fingers wide. To protect your wrists, press into the floor with the pads
of the fingers and thumbs.

2 .  Notice how at this point your elbows are behind your wrists. The
key to achieving Crow Pose is to bring your weight forward enough
so the elbows stack above the wrists. This means being confident in
your arm strength and ability to bend the elbows while bringing your
shoulders forward and down. It is this action which will allow the feet
to lift. Rather than trying to “hop” the feet up, just focus on bending
the elbows to around 90 degrees while you move them forward
above the wrists. Your head will drop a little towards the ground. As a
by-product of all this, your feet will float effortlessly up in the air and
you will have achieved Crow Pose. Stay for five to ten breaths.

1 .  Take a low squat with the knees wide apart and the toes turned
out. Fold at the hips, to lean the torso well forward. Move your
ribcage as far forward between the thighs and as low down as
possible. From this deep squat, walk your palms forward to allow you
to bring your elbows to the floor, forearms parallel. Press the inner
wrists and thumb knuckles down to the floor so they don’t lift.

2 .  Now lift your hips higher as you rise up onto tiptoes to wrap your
knees around the upper arms. Take your knees as high up as
possible, pressing them to your outer arms. Draw up from the belly to
create a strong centre. As you bend more at the elbows, tip your
torso forward and lift your toes in the air to come into your forearm
balance. It will feel a bit like nose-diving, so turn your head to the
side. Hold for five to ten breaths. When we achieve a challenging
pose, the mind can let go and the exit may be less dignified than the
entry. Come out with mindfulness, reversing your moves to return to
the low squat.

1 .  From standing, fold forward with bent knees to take your palms to
the floor, shoulder-width apart and just under the shoulders. Turn
your toes out and lift your heels to come onto tiptoes. Lift your hips
and widen your knees apart, to wrap them around your upper-arm
bones. There is a natural resting point for various body types – you
might have your knees lower down, close to your elbows, or right up
near your armpits.

2 .  Often the best way to lift your feet is to not think about them. As
you bend your elbows, move your torso forward. This will ease your
elbows forward and keep them sitting exactly above the wrist joints.
At the same time, lower your shoulders toward elbow height. As you
do this, your feet will float up into the air – there’s no need to do any
work to lift the toes. To help you balance, press your fingertips into
the floor so that your forearm muscles activate. Experience your
hands like a crow’s feet “clawing” the earth. Balance here for several
breaths.

3 .  Now prepare for the jump-back. First, look forward rather than
down. Squeeze your knees together to build the tension you will need
initially, to propel yourself back. Prepare to shift your chest forward in
the air, so that you will stay balanced over your hands for as long as
possible. Now get ready to use your abdominal muscles to lift your
hips up as you shoot your legs back. Be as symmetrical as possible
with your legs as they perform this movement. Initially, this might be
an explosive movement, but with practice and as your confidence
builds, you will be able to slow it down, to “float” the legs gracefully
back to a light landing.

4 .  You are now in the Plank position. Take your awareness to the
vertebrae between your shoulder blades and lift this area up to
eradicate any gully between the shoulder blades. When you do this, it
may feel as if it narrows the upper chest. To balance out this action,
broaden across your collar bones and roll your shoulders back
slightly. Hold the Plank position for five to ten breaths.

F l E X I B L E  F O R W A R D  F O L D S
Forward-folding postures feature heavily in yoga. They stretch
out your whole back body – thighs, calves and back. They can
help decompress the spine and relieve back pain and tension.
They draw the awareness inward and can feel wonderful both
during and afterward. And yes, life can feel better with looser
hamstrings. It feels good to move with grace and pick up
dropped items with ease.
But remember, even if your hamstrings don’t lengthen as
quickly as you wish, that yoga is actually a state of mind. If
ever you catch yourself getting grumpy at your stubbornly
short hamstrings, while forcing your nose to your knees, or
comparing your flexibility to that of others, the best thing you
can do is practise detachment and self-acceptance.
Keep in mind that it’s not about measuring how far you go in
a forward fold, but more about how deeply you can release for
the duration. With floor-based postures, balance isn’t generally
an issue, so you have the opportunity to surrender to gravity
rather than work against it. Don’t invite struggle into your life –
there’s probably enough of that already, and it will only make
your body tighten up more. Don’t force your body to go where
it’s not ready to.
As forward bends are generally calming postures, practise
surrendering to the present moment. Settle into your breath,
honour the temple of your body and let it unfold in its own time.
Don’t measure your hamstrings; measure your ability to
release. Develop self-acceptance and practise being content
with where you are: right here, right now. That’s yoga. And
that’s a practice you can really enjoy.

1 .  Stand with your feet about 40cm (15in) from the wall. Have your
feet hip-width apart, with your toes pointing forward. Lean your
buttocks to the wall. The next movement might feel funny, but it’s
worth doing to get the most out of this pose. Reach one hand back to
each buttock and, one at a time, tilt to pull the buttock flesh up and
out to the side. This will allow you to nestle your sitting bones into the
wall. Bend your knees, too, so that you can create the deepest
possible forward fold at the hips. Take your fingertips to the floor in
front, shoulder-width apart. Still with knees bent, work on finding the
length from your pubic bone to your throat. On each inhalation your
ribcage will float up a bit, which will create a little space. Then as you
exhale you’ll have the opportunity to release into this space, by
reaching the heart centre forward to increase your stretch.

2 .  As you hold, breathe and warm into the pose, and straighten your
legs by sliding your sitting bones up the wall. This will increase the
pelvic tilt, as will the angle of your legs. Sometimes we round the
back and shut the breathing down a little in forward bends, but with
the hands in front, you have a great opportunity to minimize that. You
can use yoga blocks to help your body open further: walk your hands
further forward to allow a really pleasant long and “flat” feeling along
the front of the torso. If you don’t have props handy, you can take
your hands to the seat of a chair placed in front of you. After ten or
more breaths, bend the knees and inhale to come up. Stand quietly
to feel the effects of this pose.

1 .  Sit with the soles of your feet together and knees wide. Take your
fingertips to the floor behind you. To set up the necessary forward tilt
for the pelvis, lean back onto your fingertips, press them into the floor
and draw your lower back inward while your chest lifts. It’s nice to
open your feet apart, so that the big toes move away from each
other like the pages of an open book. As you do this, allow the knees
to move apart. This widening action is what will best allow the knees
to lower to the floor, rather than trying to force them straight down.

2 .  Now deepen the posture by rotating the pelvis forward even more.
It’s nice to maintain the thigh bones where they are, so think about
the hip sockets moving forward around the head of the bones. If you
can maintain the inward curve of the lower back, you can bring your
fingertips to the floor in front and walk them away as you deepen the
forward fold. If you find that your pelvis tilts backward as you let go of
the floor behind you, you aren’t yet ready for hands in front. Stay
where you are for five to ten breaths.

3 .  Now add the release for the right buttock. Sit up and line up your
right heel with your left toes. Starting with the hands behind once
again, follow the same steps, moving into your deepest forward tilt. If
you can, take your hands forward and walk them out front. Stay for
five or ten long breaths, or for as long as you enjoy it. The come up
and practise the other side.

1 .  Sit with your knees bent up in front of you. Slide your forearms
under your thighs and catch hold of each elbow. Now bring your spine
into a well-rounded position. With your elbows held firmly, draw your
ribs as far away from the fronts of your thighs as possible. Contract
the abdominals into the lower back. Let your armpits move toward
your elbows while you allow your shoulder blades to cleave away
from each other. To assist with this rounding movement, tuck your
tailbone under and draw your chin into your throat. Stay for several
long breaths.

2 .  Now reverse the work. Lift your head and chest up as you flatten
your back. Take your pelvis out of its backward tilt and into a forward
tilt. Move your ribs forward and, as you lengthen the space between
your front hip bones and your lowest ribs, your back will flatten. Now,
with that flat-back feeling, exhale and close the gap by “laying” your
belly and chest onto your thighs. Next, slide your feet forward slowly,
until you feel your belly and chest wanting to separate from your
thighs. Stop here and take five breaths.

3 .  Keeping your legs in their new further-away position, round your
spine again while you create the most air space possible between
your legs and your torso. “Give” your shoulders to your elbows while
you separate your shoulder blades. Keep your chin in and your pelvis
tucked under. Breathe! If you are very flexible, remove your forearms
from under your legs to allow them to straighten completely, and
clasp your heels.
Then reverse the pelvic tilt again and squash the air out from
between your legs and torso by lengthening your torso from the pubic
bone to the throat, flattening your back as much as possible. Keeping
your abdomen and thighs together, slide your feet away some more.
Repeat these two steps again. Come up, feel the difference and
smile.

1 .  Lie on your back with your knees bent up and your feet on the
floor. Lift your right foot up and bring your knee in toward the right
armpit. Clasp your inner heel with your right hand and press down, so
that your thigh slides down past the side of your torso and your knee
moves toward the floor. If that’s not manageable, grab your ankle or
shin, or loop a soft belt around your instep and hold that. If it feels
comfortable, slide your left foot away, to add in a stretch for your left
hip and thigh. Place your left palm on the top of that left thigh, to
encourage it to ease down to the floor. Otherwise, keep your left
knee bent up as you continue to step 2.

2 .  Now it’s time to play with the resistance, which will bring a whole
new quality to your stretch. Attempt to straighten your right knee
while you continue to place pressure on your right heel. Try to bend
your right elbow and, as you resist by pressing away with the leg,
allow the leg to “win”. Straighten the leg as much as you comfortably
can, but maintain the resistance with your arm. This should feel like a
deep but healthy stretch. After about ten breaths, come out and
repeat this sequence on the second side.

3 .  To come into the full Happy Baby, take both legs up, holding the
heels. Tilt to one side, and then move back and forth, to rock your
baby. This will encourage the hip-opening. Then settle into symmetry
and enjoy your breathing. If your knees are close to the floor, add a
degree of difficulty by bringing your pelvis into a forward tilt, as if to
aim your tailbone closer to the floor and as if to pull your lower back
away from the floor and into its natural curved shape. Hold and
breathe while this stretch develops.

4 .  Now begin to straighten your legs as they move wide apart into a
V-shape. Once again, resist with your arms, trying to bend your
elbows, yet allow the legs to be victorious. If you can straighten your
legs all the way, increase the challenge by changing your pelvic tilt, to
lengthen your sitting bones down away from the heels and curve your
lower back up slightly off the floor.

1 .  Sit on the floor with your legs outstretched. Slide your right foot in
and bring your knee out to the side. Place your toes roughly level
with your left knee: take your foot slightly away from your inner leg,
so that each heel is in front of its respective hip bone and both hips
are fairly square-on to the front. Flex your ankle so that the “blade” of
the foot – the little-toe edge – is in contact with the floor. If your hips
are more open, bring your heel in toward your groin. In this position,
more of the top of the foot will touch the ground. This option will allow
for a deep release in the right side of the lower back.
After choosing your leg option, take your left hand behind you, and
bring your right hand to the outer left thigh or knee. Inhale and float
your spine tall as you twist to the left. The lower back will rotate
better for you if it’s in its natural convex shape, so be sure to press
into the floor with your left hand to assist this curve. Squeeze your
abdominal muscles toward the left, so that your pubic bone moves a
little to the left. Stay in this upright twist for five to ten breaths.

2 .  Maintaining the left-sided rotation of the torso, reach your right
hand as far as possible down the left leg. Hold your foot, if you can.
Bring your left hand to join the right. Due to the set-up twist, your
shoulders can be level with each other. Breathe for five to ten long,
slow breaths. If you are flexible enough to reach, clasp your right
wrist with your left hand and have the palm of the right hand facing
away from you. Once you have a hold, press the ball of the foot
away and enjoy the way this adds to the stretch in the shoulders.
Repeat to practise side two.

1 .  Sit with your left leg outstretched. Taking your right foot behind
you, bend your right knee out to the side so that your thighs are
perpendicular to each other. Ensure the top of your right foot is in
contact with the floor. Your toes will point toward your right buttock.
Take your left hand to your right outer knee and your right fingertips
to the floor behind your back. Draw yourself up to create a dignified
elegance. Then you will be ready to twist to the right. Involve your
abdominal muscles in this twist, so that they squeeze around to the
right. In addition, your arms will act as levers to spiral you round.
Consciously activate the muscles of the mid- and upper back to draw
you further round another notch or two. Stay for five to ten breaths.

2 .  Now change the direction of your twist by taking both hands to the
floor, one on either side of your left leg. Revolve your lower
abdominals as far to the left as possible. Walk your hands away a
little, so that the forward stretch is not too intense. Find your beautiful
alignment before you deepen the intensity: taking an inhalation, lift
your front ribs up and away from your hips. This will create space in
your body and help flatten your back. Then, as you exhale, move
your belly button forward and down the left thigh, to close the space
between your midriff and your leg. Maintaining a sense of length from
your pubic bone to your throat, walk your hands away, grasping the
foot, if possible. Hold for five to ten breaths.

3 .  Come on up and return to the upright right-sided twist. Stay for
several long breaths, then unravel and repeat the long forward fold
over your left leg. Enjoy the sense of your body opening, with this
chance to revisit and deepen these two postures. Then practice side
two.

1 .  Warm up your hip first by cradling your right lower leg; you can
simply slip your bent elbows under your calf as you slowly rock it
from side to side, like a baby, or you can cup the knee and foot in
your hands and press them toward each other. Don’t collapse into
your lower back – pull the lower back into its natural curve and feel
how your chest lifts as you sit tall. As your hip releases, close the gap
between your shin and chest. If you can, lift your foot higher.

2 .  Ease your right knee back behind your right armpit. Hunch over
forward a little and position your right upper arm under your right
thigh, to help press the knee back another little bit and find that hip-
opening action even more. Then undo any slouching, to sit as tall as
possible again. Place your right palm on the floor beside, or if
possible behind, your buttock. Take your left hand to your right foot.

3 .  You are now ready to straighten your right leg by pressing your
right foot into your left hand to lift it up into the air. With the right
upper arm jammed into the back of the leg (to maintain the hip-
opening position), this means that you have to squeeze on the
muscles of your right front thigh to get the leg as straight as possible.
Press the floor away with your right hand, as you turn your torso and
head upward, to gaze up. If you feel good here, go for the arm lock
in step 4.

4 .  Release your right hand from the floor and, rotating from the
shoulder, turn your palm outward. Your elbow will bend and lift up.
Slide the back of your hand under your right thigh and place it against
your sacrum. Similarly, release your left hand and rotate the palm
out, thumb down. The elbow will bend up and allow your left hand to
slide down to the lower back. Grasp your left wrist with your right
hand. Straighten your elbows as much as possible, lift your chest and
straighten your right knee. After several breaths, release and practise
side two.

1 .  To prepare your hip for the Half-Lotus, sit on the floor and take
your right leg up to cradle the baby, like step 1 of the Hip-Opening
Heron Pose . Once you feel warmed up, bend your right knee out to
the side, to place your right ankle as high up your left thigh as
possible. Snuggle your right heel into the left groin. This is a Half-
Lotus position. Don’t hold this pose if there is any discomfort in your
knee; instead, come out and move on to the “Happy Hips” section to
develop the flexibility in your hips. If your knee feels fine, then stay
here, allowing the knee to drop lower as the right hip releases. To
help prepare for the balancing forward fold, take a Half-Lotus
Forward Fold by bending over the left leg while it’s grounded. Again,
check that there is no discomfort in the bent knee while you hold for
a full minute, breathing slowly and evenly.

2 .  Sitting upright, slide your left foot in as you bend the left knee up
and slightly out to the left. Reach forward to catch your left foot with
both hands. Grasp your calf or ankle, if you can’t reach the foot.
3 .  Straighten your left leg up into the air, as you bring that knee more
to the centre. Close the gap between your torso and your legs while
you balance, and take the stretch as deep as feels great. Hold for
five to ten breaths.

4 .  Now let go of your leg and extend your arms out to horizontal.
Lean back, curving your spine into a C-shape, and work your
abdominal muscles. To increase the strengthening effect, lower your
legs away to create more of a boat shape. Hold for six breaths or
longer, until you feel your abdominals fatiguing with the effort.

J U I C Y  T W I S T S
Twists may appear less glamorous or exciting than some other
yoga poses, but they offer enormous health benefits. Yogis
understand that having a flexible spine feels a bit like tapping
into the fountain of youth. As twists increase your spinal range
of motion, they not only keep you looking young, but feeling
young, too. Some of the aims in yoga, when working with the
spine, are to strengthen and stabilize it, mobilize it, allow it to
relax and lengthen, and to create differentiation.
A twist can tick all these boxes. It can work wonders for
back pain and it also aids the digestive process. Like the yoga
side-stretches, twists are great counterposes after forward
bends and backbends. And they are excellent preparatory
poses, too, making any subsequent pose more accessible.
Twists can feel like an amazing tonic for your nervous
system. They bring you back into balance and help neutralize
the fluctuations of the mind. Twists work whether you are
feeling stressed-and-wired or stressed-and-tired. If you are
feeling heavy, fatigued or mentally sluggish, twists give you a
lift, helping you feel refreshed, buoyant and energized. Try a
therapeutic twist next time you have a mid-afternoon slump.
However, if you are feeling scattered, fragmented and can’t
focus, twists will ground you and bring you “home”, much
closer to the calm and peaceful self that always resides within.

1 .  Lie on your back with your knees bent up, and your feet on the
floor. Take your arms out wide, with your hands at shoulder level.
Your palms can be up or down, whichever you prefer. To keep your
spine more even in the twist, lift your hips and move them 5cm (2in)
to the left side.

2 .  Now bend your knees into your chest. Wrap your right arm around
both shins and use it to guide your legs all the way to the right, so
that the thighs stay as close as possible to your torso. Once on the
floor, ease your right arm out from under your legs and drape it over
the top leg. Press your left shoulder toward the earth, and slide it and
your left hand further to the left to increase the stretch. Find the
position that feels nicest for your neck: looking right, up or left. Allow
all the work to stop, let everything go and feel deliciously heavy. Stay
for ten or 15 breaths.

3 .  Now move the emphasis of the twist further down the spine. Take
your thighs away from the torso and create right-angles at the hips
and the knees. Your feet will be in a line straight down from your
knees. Your knees will fall in the straight line extending out from the
hips. Allow your top knee to sit a little behind your lower knee. If your
lower back is strong and you would like to develop the twist, press
your top knee forward so that both knees stack, as you earth your
left shoulder down. Check your head position to make sure your neck
is happy in this pose and breathe for eight to 15 rounds.

4 .  Now move to a more active twist. Bend the knees in close and cup
your right palm over both sets of toes. If this isn’t manageable, grasp
a soft belt looped around the balls of the feet. Straighten your legs as
much as possible while aiming the feet toward shoulder level. Stack
your top heel over the bottom heel. Use that as an anchor point and
set up a radiation in the direction of your left hand. Squeeze your
abdominals to the left to allow your left shoulder to ground down.
Ease your left shoulder toward your left hand. Stay for eight or more
breaths. Come out and, starting from the centre, work through the
second side.

1 .  Lie on your back with your knees bent into your chest. Rest your
right arm on your shins and hug your knees in close. Use your
abdominal muscles to help draw the thighs in. Then guide your legs
to the right so that they rest on the floor, with your knees as close to
your armpit as possible. Place your right arm across your knees, to
remind the hip and thigh muscles to soften. Then find the most
luxurious position for your left arm. You can bend the elbow and
place your palm on your ribs, but most people like to have their back
arm out to the side, palm up. To give the side of your torso a little
more release, slide your arm higher up so that it’s closer to your ear.
Now seek out the nicest way to position your head and neck. First
close your eyes, then very slowly move your head from looking to the
right over toward the left. Somewhere along the route there will be a
happy ‘Ahhh’ feeling, signalling where your neck likes to be. It’s often
different on each side.

2 .  Once you are comfortable, settle in and stay there for a minute or
so. Turn your focus to any areas of the body that are tight and
encourage them to release. Consider the usual suspects – back,
shoulders, neck – but also roam freely. Is there any tension holding in
the soles of the feet? How are the buttocks? What about your jaw?
Bringing awareness to tight or tender areas starts the path of healing
and softening.
To move into a feeling of actively spiralling, lift your feet up, angling
your shins to point both knees downward. This will activate the
oblique muscles of your core. Recommit your left shoulder to the
floor. This will also impact on your breathing – it might feel shorter or
less smooth. Bring mindfulness to your breath so that it can round
out more. Stay for five to eight breaths. Then practise side two.

1 .  Sit in an easy cross-legged pose. If you feel stiff, sit on a cushion
to lift your hips in relation to your knees. If cross-legged doesn’t work
for you, try kneeling with your knees apart or together. Cup your right
knee with your left hand and find a good spot on the floor,
somewhere out from your tailbone, to place your right palm or
fingertips. The first step of your twist is to think about your lower
abdomen. Elongate as you take a full inhalation, then on an exhale
switch on your abdominal muscles and direct them firmly to the right.
Notice how far you move during this first stage of your rotation. It will
be a combination of strength in the torso muscles and the work of
both arms.
2 .  Inhale and draw yourself tall once again. As you exhale, squeeze
the upper abdomen around to the right to rotate further. Keep your
belly muscles on, so that they draw inward to your centre.
3 .  Your abdomen will feel tight and strong, so you will feel your next
inhalation more in the chest. As you breathe in, allow the chest to lift,
and then exhale and move it as much as possible into your twist.
4 .  Finally, think of your shoulders. Inhale and lengthen from tailbone
to crown, then exhale and move both shoulders further into the twist.
On an exhalation, come out of the twist – as you do so, you may feel
a release of pressure, like opening a bottle of sparkling water. Enjoy
these bubbles of release while you sit symmetrically. Then work with
the second side, again working from bottom to top. Try this four-step
bottom-to-top process in other twists, such as the Cow-Pose Spirals .

Seek advice for all twists if you are at risk of disc herniation. If you have sacroiliac
dysfunction, don’t attempt to keep your hips square to the front. Instead, as you twist to
the right, slide your left buttock forward a little and allow your right hip to move back in
relation to the left hip. Don’t over-tighten the abdominal muscles in pregnancy. Avoid
strong twists with some inflammatory digestive conditions.

1 .  For Sage Pose, first sit and bring both feet around to the left. Have
the toes of your left foot pointing straight back, and place your right
foot over the instep of the left. You will feel a natural tipping to the
right, so do your best to snuggle your left buttock down toward the
floor. If you feel too lopsided, level the hips more by lifting your seat.
To level out, sit on a folded blanket or a yoga block. Rotating to your
right side, take your left hand to the right knee and position your right
fingertips on the floor behind you. Use your arms as levers to help
you come into a deep and satisfying twist.

2 .  Once you are settled in your twist, set up your first neck stretch.
Starting from a neutral head position, where your jawline is parallel to
the floor, rotate your head to the right so that you are looking behind
you. Ensure it feels comfortable. Now, tilt your head by dropping your
right earlobe down to your right shoulder. Bring your chin closer to
your throat. Now squeeze on the muscles by your armpits, to lower
your left shoulder. Experience a fairly strong diagonal line of stretch
along the left side of your neck. If you wish, create a tiny nodding
action. Stay for three to five long breaths.

3 .  Stay in the twist, but return your head and neck to a neutral
position. Keeping a sense of elongation in the neck, swivel your head
to the left, so that you are looking over your left shoulder. First tilt the
face downward a small amount, tucking the chin in. Then drop your
left ear down. Accentuate the stretch along the neck and back
shoulder by lowering the right shoulder. Hold for five breaths, then
release the head to neutral. Come out of the twist and stretch your
legs out in front of you. Take a moment to check in with how your
neck feels. Then swing your legs to the right, ready to practise the
second side.

1 .  A great adjunct to this pose is to raise your seat by sitting on a
foam brick or a blanket folded four times. Sit on your support, or on
the floor, and bend your knees up in front. Place your feet a little
wider than your shoulders and turn your toes out. This will allow your
knees to ease away from each other, so that you get an inner-thigh
stretch as well. Hold your left shin, ankle or, if possible, foot with your
left hand. Tap your right hand to your left, then reach your right hand
out and up in a wide arc.

2 .  Make sure your abdominal section is involved in this twist. Your
core muscles will switch on, to help the rotation from your solar
plexus. Combined with the elevating reach of your right arm, you may
feel a diagonal pull as the upper right part of your abdomen moves
away from your lower left side. Anchor yourself by pressing your left
arm to your left leg. Then come alive through your centre, as you
continue to radiate your right arm up and away. Hold for five to ten
breaths, then rest.

3 .  To come into the loop, slide your left armpit down to your left inner
thigh, just before the knee. It will feel as if this shortens the left side
of the torso, but it’s all part of the contract-and-release benefits of a
twist: some parts of you will condense, others will expand. Once your
left shoulder is as low as it can go, rotate from your shoulder in order
to slide your left forearm under your left thigh, then bring the back of
your hand across until it rests on your sacrum.

4 .  With your lower arm locked in place, reach your upper arm up and
away, as in step 1. Rotating from the shoulder, turn your right thumb
forward and down. As you bend your elbow up, bring your right hand
low, to slide the back of it across your lower back. Curl your fingers to
lock the hands together or, if you can, grasp your right wrist with your
left hand. If you can’t reach, complete the loop between both hands
by holding a soft belt.
5 .  To add that extra bit to your twist, and to accentuate the shoulder
and hip stretches, send a current of energy through both elbows to
straighten them. As you do this, move your hands away from your
body, so that eventually your hands don’t touch your body at all. Stay
for five breaths. Then repeat on the second side.

1 .  Starting on your hands and knees, inhale and reach your right arm
up in the air. As you exhale, sweep your right arm out wide and
down, to slide your forearm under your left armpit. Your left elbow will
bend on this downward movement, allowing you to snuggle your right
shoulder to the floor. Repeat three to five times, inhaling as your right
arm moves through a wide upward arc and exhaling each time you
“thread the needle”.

2 .  To move into the fully threaded needle, you will be bringing your
right arm through your inner thighs. Set up this movement from your
all-fours starting position by rolling your right shoulder forward, so
that your elbow lifts up and your palm faces right. As you slide your
forearm through the legs, the blade of the little-finger end of your
hand will be closest to the floor. Bend your left elbow to allow your
head and right shoulder to rest to the floor. Slide the back of your
right hand as high up as possible, to rest against your right buttock.
Now lift your left arm up into the air and, rotating through the
shoulder, bend the elbow and turn your palm backward, thumb down.
Slide the back of the hand across your lower back and lock the
fingers of both hands. A common error is to loop the hands around
the left buttock, so check that you have looped around the more
challenging right hip. If possible, hold your left wrist with your right
hand. Juice up this twist by straightening as much as possible
through the elbows. Try not to touch your buttock with your hands, as
your shoulders press away from the ears. After at least five breaths,
come out. Kneel to sit symmetrically and feel the differences in your
body. Repeat on the second side.

1 .  Kneel on all fours and bring your left shin forward between your
hands. If you feel comfortable, position your left foot further forward,
so that your shin is more perpendicular to your body. If you are less
flexible, your left knee will point forward while your left foot will be
closer to your right hip. Slide your right leg as far back and away as
possible. If your left buttock doesn’t touch the floor, place a yoga
brick or folded blanket underneath it: you should feel able to lift both
hands without any major shift occurring while your hips settle into this
stretch. Press your palms to the floor and enjoy the way your spine
curves into a long, upward-lifting sweep. Now take your twist to the
right. With your left hand placed on your left knee or the ground
nearby, reach your right hand to the back of your right leg. Lift tall
each time you inhale, then revolve a little more each time you exhale.
Imagine a pleasant squeeze through the right lower back and kidney
area. Enhance that by sliding your right fingers further down the leg.
Choose whether you prefer to allow your right hip bone to slide back,
taking it with you into the twist, or whether you would like to increase
the intensity by pressing it forward as if to square the hips. Hold for
at least five breaths.

2 .  Return to face forward, ready to twist to the left. Relax your hips
toward the floor. Position your right hand to the floor in front or, if you
can, on your left knee. Reach around with your left hand and slide
the back of the hand across your lower back. Rotate your palm down
to hold your clothing, or cup it across your right hip. If your left foot is
near that hip, it might even be possible for you to loop your thumb
and first two fingers around your big toe. Hold for five breaths or
more. Then release out of the pose, ready for side two.

your knee. Avoid strong twists with some inflammatory digestive conditions. Take it
easy during pregnancy and don’t over-tighten the abdominal muscles.
C A U T I O N S
Avoid lateral work if you have an inflamed liver or spleen. Modify postures by working
with an experienced teacher during pregnancy or after abdominal surgery. Take care if
you have a hiatus hernia, an extreme heart condition or any inflammation of the organs.

In some ways lateral stretches are the unsung heroes of yoga
practice. We don’t seem to really stretch our side-bodies much
in our day-to-day lives, so to do so during yoga can feel
amazing – like opening the door to a previously undiscovered
room in a mansion. With yoga practice you will shine the light
into this room. It may be a little musty, but use these postures
to dust it off and you will find that your whole body runs a little
better.
As a valuable part of our core unit, side-body strengtheners
help our stability, power and balance. But you don’t only want
strength – you need the stretching, too. Lateral releases are
invaluable for stretching out tight lower backs. They are great
twist-enhancers, bring backbends along like magic, allow your
breathing to blossom, make you feel taller and give you a more
elegant posture.
You will find lots of other side-body stretches and
strengtheners throughout this book. But read on for some
favourite ways to work with this group of postures and enjoy
discovering how they will be champions for your body.

1 .  Step your feet 1.2–1.5m (4–5ft) apart. You’ll choose the wider
range if you have longer or more flexible legs. Moving from the thigh,
turn your right foot in by about 15 degrees. With your left toes
pointing straight out to the left, bend your left knee so that it sits
above your left ankle. To come into the first stage, reach your left
elbow to your left knee and take your right arm up to vertical.
Rotating from the shoulder joint, turn your right palm to the left and
extend your arm to hover above your right ear.

2 .  Now finesse the side-stretch. First, ease off the reach through the
top arm. Bend your top elbow, and allow your right forearm and wrist
to flop. Lift your right elbow straight up and also away from your right
hip. Now, in a subtle shift of about 5cm (2in), slide your left hip
toward the left and deepen the arc from left hip to left armpit, further
increasing the length through the right side of the lower back. Finally,
imagine that you are a fish, using its side-gills to breathe. Visualize
your breath moving in and out of your right-side ribs, as if it were
bypassing your nose.

3 .  If you would like to go deeper, take the left palm to the floor.
Choose whether to straighten your right arm to form the classic Side-
Angle Pose or continue to work with the elbow to fingertips nicely
floppy. Enjoy breathing in and out of your right “gills” for several more
breaths. Each slow, deep intake of air will stretch the little muscles in
between the ribs, as the ribcage expands. This will reset your
breathing, so that you can breathe slower and deeper, which will help
you feel more relaxed. It sets up a cycle of positive reinforcement: as
you relax more, you breathe more slowly; then, as you breathe more
slowly, you can relax more. Who would have thought that breathing
like a fish could feel so nourishing? Then come back up, to work the
second side.

1 .  From kneeling, take your right leg out so that the right foot is level
with your left knee. Have your toes reaching away to the right. Lift up
all your toes, fan them apart, then place them on the floor, stretched
out wide. Really move them away from each other, as if they were
greedy for extra spce. Lean to the left as you place your left fist or
palm on the floor, also in line with your left knee. Take your right hand
behind your head to cup the base of your skull. Position your hold so
that you can take as much load off the neck as possible.

2 .  Add a flowing twist to this side-stretch. Revolving from the lower
abdomen, exhale and turn your torso toward the floor, while your top
elbow moves forward. Inhale and spiral through the torso as your
elbow moves to the sky. Continue exhaling to close, and inhaling to
open, for several more rounds.
3 .  Once you are facing forward again, release the head support and
lengthen your right arm up and over to the left with your palm facing
down.
4 .  Work systematically now, to “grow” a little. Press down through
those widely spread right toes again, particularly through the big-toe
knuckle and the whole ball of the foot. These will be your anchor
points. Now start to progressively create a strong line of energy along
the whole of the right side. Lift up from your right ankle toward your
right knee. Then firm the quadriceps, so that the kneecap lifts toward
your right hip. Lift and lengthen your side-ribs up and away from your
right hip. Then reach your armpit away from your waist. Firm your
upper-arm muscles to the arm bone, and move your elbow away
from your shoulder. Visualize little pockets of space being created in
these joints. Next, move your wrist away from your elbow. Spread the
skin on the palm of your hand as you fan your fingers away.
Lengthen through each finger and your thumb, again sensing space
being made in each of these little joints. Breathe, expand and enjoy,
before working with the second side.

1 .  From the Plank position (see strengthening sun salutation and step
5 ), sway your heels to the left. Press through your left hand as you
lift your right arm up to vertical. At the same time, lift your right hip to
stack both hips in one line. Ensure that your weight-bearing shoulder
draws down away from the ear. In yoga, we don’t like to wear the
shoulders as earrings.

2 .  You are aiming to rest your weight on the little-toe blade of your
left foot, with your right foot lined up on top. A slightly easier option is
to position the top foot in front of the bottom foot, heel to toe. If you
don’t yet have the strength for this, you can bend your top knee and
place your right foot on the floor in front of your left knee, as shown.

3 .  From your starting point as a flat line from feet through hips to
shoulders, now create an arch. Work the muscles of your waist to lift
your hips up and curve your shape. This will take some of the load off
the shoulder and will work your oblique abdominals more. Do this on
the exhalation and, as you inhale, return to your straight line. If you
can manage it, reach your arm overhead to form part of the curve
each time you exhale, then return it up to vertical on your inhalation.
Continue contracting your waist away from the floor and slowly lifting
to curve as you exhale, while lowering with control and mindfulness
on your inhalations. Complete five rounds.

4 .  Then come down and sit back. Offer your wrists a counterpose by
curling your fingers down as if to tickle your forearms. You are now
ready to work side two.

1 .  Lie on your back with your arms just wide from the hips, palms
down. Bring the soles of your feet together. Allow your knees to drop
apart from each other. This is usually a yoga signal for the body to
relax, so take a few long, slow breaths to enjoy this position before
you begin your strength work.

2 .  To prepare to lift up, press the soles of the feet together actively.
Squeeze your buttock muscles and, keeping your knees wide, lift
your hips as high as possible off the floor. Roll your shoulders under
to give more lift to the chest. Feel your back muscles working
strongly to keep you in an arched shape.
3 .  Take an inhalation and then, on each exhalation, shunt your hips
from side to side. When you breathe in, return to the middle; when
you breathe out, slide to the side. As you move to the right, reinforce
your lift so that your left hip doesn’t drop. Each time you slide left, do
your best to maintain the lift on the right side.

4 .  If you wish, purse your lips and breathe out through your mouth,
which will help the core muscles to work. Each time you move to the
side, the muscles at the side of your waist will activate. After
completing eight slow slides, you can work more dynamically. Use a
faster exhalation to mirror a strong, quick slide to each side for eight
more rounds. Then rest down and hug your knees into your chest.

1 .  Lie on your back with your arms stretched overhead. Take hold of
your left wrist with your right hand. Pull on your left wrist a little as
you slide your torso into a small right-hand curve. Don’t go so far that
your left shoulder lifts up. Instead, both shoulder blades will remain
with fairly even pressure on the floor.
2 .  Next, walk your feet to the right, keeping your left buttock heavy
on the floor. Don’t go beyond the point where you feel discomfort.
Your feet might only move 30–40cm (12–16in). This pose is a case
where less is definitely more. To achieve the benefits of it, you will be
using the gift of time, rather than an extreme stretch. If it feels good,
rest your left ankle on top of your right. Then relax all efforts. Rest
here, using soft belly-breathing, for three to five minutes. Set a timer
if you like, so that you can be even on each side. Aside from a lovely
lengthening along the left side of your body, observe how the right
side of your abdomen is pleasantly compressed. Get a sense of the
ascending colon on that left side enjoying a squish, like a massage,
to help it with its job of digestion. Imagine all the organs on that right
side – the liver, gall-bladder and right kidney – getting a yoga
massage, to help them with their work of keeping your body healthy.
Meanwhile ponder on how all the organs of the left side – the
stomach, pancreas, spleen, left kidney and descending colon –
experience a soothing and gentle sense of unsquashing, so that they,
too, can work really well for your body, to achieve vibrant health.
3 .  Move your legs back to the centre. Then return your upper body to
symmetry. As you lie stretched out and floppy, notice how long and
relaxed you feel on that left side. Then repeat on the second side.

1 .  Lie on your back, with your knees bent up and your feet on the
floor. Lift your buttocks and move them about 6cm (2½in) to the
right. Bend your right knee into your right armpit, then take hold of
your right heel in your right hand, to form a half Happy-Baby Pose .

2 .  Now work the right leg straight, in a way that really allows the
hamstrings to let go. Press down with your right hand onto your heel,
as if to compress the leg bones back into the hip socket. While your
hand presses down and your elbow tries to bend, allow your leg to
“win”: it will straighten as the heel presses away. Once your right leg
is as straight as it will go, slide your left foot out to straighten the left
leg. Then move that foot about 30cm (12in) to the right, to create a
half-banana shape. Finally, drape your left arm along the floor
overhead, and slide your hand about 20cm (8in) away to the right, to
finish your banana shape. As best you can, rest your torso and left
shoulder blade down more heavily on the floor, to enhance this side-
stretch.

3 .  To increase the stretch even more, lift your left arm up and across
the front of your torso, to catch your right toes with your hand. It
helps to lift your head as you do this.

4 .  Once you have your grip, roll back so that both sides of your back
are equally weighted to the floor and rest your head down. Continue
to reach away through your right heel. Send energy down through
your left leg to your heel as well. Take five to ten long, slow breaths,
before coming out to complete side two.

Your core is more than just those tummy muscles. Your core
muscles include those of the pelvic floor, your back muscles,
side-waist muscles and diaphragm. Think of it like a house.
You would never build on shaky foundations, so you need to
prepare with a strong pelvic floor. You need to build steady
walls (belly, side-waist and back) and then a stable roof
(diaphragm muscle), too. These muscles work together to give
you support and the power to move, and to help you balance.
They keep you safe and injury-free.
The core work of classical yoga has become more
accessible. Traditionally yoga uses bandhas , or energy locks,
and the ones that are most relevant to core work are subtle
activations of the muscles at the lower abdomen and pelvic
floor. The ancient yogis got it right, but these energy locks
were tricky to describe in a group yoga class, so not all
modern-day yogis could connect with them. Modern-day
physiotherapy, plus the influence of Pilates, has opened the
door for today’s yogis to develop their core work effectively.
Yoga builds strength by supporting your own weight in a
static position, or by organizing you to hold your body correctly
as you move. It’s lovely to be self-sufficient with your core unity
work. No fancy equipment is needed and you can do it
anywhere.
While there are core-specific practices in this section,
remember that yoga is a great package deal. There are lots
more core practices throughout the book to give you core
integrity, plus that long-and-lean look. In particular, the planks,
inversions and balances build core strength. You will also
recruit core muscles doing backbends and working on the side-
body. Twists using the core muscles are great, too. If you are
new to this type of work, it doesn’t take long to notice a
significant increase in your core strength, so get started and
conquer your core now.

1 .  Lie on your back, with your knees bent up and your feet hip-width
apart on the floor. Place your hands flat on your abdomen in a
diamond shape, with the tips of your thumb and index finger touching
each other. Visualize the hammock of muscles running between your
tailbone and your pubic bone – your pelvic-floor muscles.

2 .  Set up a rocking of your pelvis, forward and backward. As you
inhale, curve your lower back off the floor as your pelvis tilts
posteriorly. Your fingertips will point down and your thumb tips will
point up slightly. When you exhale, allow the squeezing of your
abdominal muscles to press the lower back down to the floor.
Contract the deeper layers of the abdominal muscles, so that you
feel your belly hollowing down away from your palms. As you perform
this scooping-out action, you will also be tucking your tailbone under,
and your pelvis will tilt anteriorly. This is a natural time to contract
your pelvic-floor muscles and draw this sling of muscles up toward
the centre of the torso. When you do this, your fingers will point
slightly up and your thumbs will angle down.
3 .  Continue this slow rocking, as if your abdomen were a compass
and you were touching down the North point of it (the tailbone) and
the South point (the lowest rib) to the floor. For this entire sequence,
move your efforts away from the type of force that makes you furrow
your brow or grit your teeth. It’s about a softer focus with a happy
curiosity, exploring any areas of duller awareness or weaker muscles.
Your relaxed breathing rate will be the guiding factor in how slowly
you move. Remember: the slower you move, the more you can
develop your ability to “scoop”. You will also have more time to
develop your awareness, and this is key to yoga practice.
4 .  Now move from your North–South rocking points to explore East
and West. First, find the central point that is right in the middle of
your North and South. Your lower back will curve gently up from the
floor in its natural, neutral arched shape. Then go toward East –
contract the abdominal muscles more on your right side, to imprint
the right half of your lower back to the floor. Inhale to return to
centre, then exhale toward West, working the left half of your belly
and focusing on pressing the left lower back to the floor. Mindfully
complete ten more East–West moments.
5 .  Now work clockwise around the compass. First press down the
North point, then East, South and West, to return to North. Stay
attuned to any lazy parts that won’t touch down easily through your
circle, and then linger there to build awareness and strength. After
five complete rounds, return to the centre and circle anticlockwise
five times.

1 .  Lie on your back and reach your arms up to vertical. As you
exhale, lengthen your tailbone away and lift your sacrum up off the
floor. Continue to reach away with your tailbone so that your back
feels luxuriously long, as you lift your lower back and mid-back up, as
high as feels comfortable. Rather than rigidly extending through the
elbows, soften them with a gentle bend and allow them to move
slightly away from each other. Drop your upper-arm bones into their
shoulder sockets, and allow your upper back to broaden and feel
heavy on the floor. This will allow you to give yourself a lovely back
massage when you begin to move.

2 .  Lift the balls of your feet to swivel your feet to one side, while you
sweep your pelvis to the other side, then start to circle the pelvis.
Continue to lengthen the tailbone away, so that the lower back
doesn’t feel compressed. Move away from strict circles, and instead
let your pelvis swish and slide. Allow your feet to sway so that they
respond in a natural way to your hip movements. Let your arms be
guided by the movements of the torso and hips. They may feel like
moving in different ways from each other, as they respond to the
flowing movements of the pelvis. Go with the flow: make it dance-
like. Try out different speeds and directions of movement. Besides
the core cultivation, you are also developing hamstring and back
muscle strength.

3 .  To come down in a core-strengthening way, reach your arms
overhead along the floor. Lift your heels so your feet are on tiptoes.
Tuck your tailbone under to elongate the lower back as much as
possible. Touching down from the upper back to the tailbone, lower
yourself down. Try to touch each vertebra down one by one. The
slower you go, the stronger your workout will be.

This pose will strengthen the all-important transverse abdominis
muscle, which acts like a corset, with its muscle fibres wrapping
horizontally around the abdomen. It protects the lower back by
switching on as you prepare for movement, and acts as an insurance
policy against injury, defending your body from repetitive stressors. It
also helps enormously in maintaining good posture.
1 .  Sit with your legs bent in front of you. Have your knees and feet
about hip-width apart. Anatomical hip width is often narrower than
you might expect: measure it out by placing a fist between your big
toes. Inhale and lift your arms overhead as you draw your spine up
tall. In particular, pull in the lower back and tilt your pelvis forward as
you perform this move.

2 .  As you exhale, draw your navel toward the spine and visualize a
hollowing-out of the belly. Reverse your pelvic tilt by tucking your
tailbone under. This tuck initiates the rolling down as your spine
rounds to a C-shape. As you roll down, lower your arms to horizontal,
with the palms on either side of your legs. Inhale as you roll back up
and activate your back muscles, to create a long, tall spine. While
your arms reach overhead, allow your shoulders to drop down away
from your ears. Exhale and scoop at the belly as you roll back down.
Repeat for ten or 15 more rounds.

3 .  Now work another two layers of abdominal muscles: the obliques.
Inhale as you flatten your back, lift your chest and reach your arms
up. When you exhale, roll down and lower both arms to the outer
right thigh. Your torso needs to twist only minimally. Most of the
sideways movement is done with the arms, and this is enough to
engage your rotational oblique muscles. Inhale up to centre, then
exhale and roll down, this time with your arms to the left. As you roll
down, keep an eye on your abdomen. If it domes outward, the wrong
muscles are working. Don’t roll down as far, so that you can ensure it
hollows inward while you develop strength. Complete ten more
rounds, alternating sides.

1 .  Come into a high kneeling position and bring your palms together
at the heart centre. Observe the natural curves of your spine in this
starting point. Then tuck your tailbone under and feel your lower
abdominal muscles activate. It helps to exhale as you do this action.
Cultivate the activation of the pelvic-floor muscles at the same time
as each exhalation. Inhale and allow your spine to return to its normal
curves, then exhale again to tilt your pelvis forward. As you do this,
you will feel the beginnings of a stretch through the front of your
thighs. When your deeper core muscles are working, your waist
draws in to become more slender.

2 .  Once you have completed several tucking-under rounds, add on a
lean-back with your torso as you exhale. Don’t allow your ribcage to
open in the front as you move back. Instead, melt the lower front ribs
down into the upper abdomen, feeling your upper belly firm. Aim to
create a straight line from your knees, through the hips to your
shoulders. You might feel a good stretch through the front thighs,
too. Complete five rounds.

3 .  Next time you inhale, return to your upright starting point and
reach both arms out in front, roughly horizontal. As you exhale,
release your right arm down and move it through a low arc to reach
back. Keep both shoulders soft as you reach away. Inhale to return
your right arm in front, palms facing each other and elbows softy
bent. Exhale, lift your pelvic-floor muscles, lean back and rotate to
the left, with your eyes following the moving thumb. Then inhale and
return to the centre. Alternating sides, continue for eight more
rounds.

1 .  Lie on your back and bend your knees up to bring your feet in the
air. Place your index fingers into the creases behind your knees. As
you exhale, use your abdominal muscles to lift your sacrum off the
floor. Your elbows will bend and widen as you lift. As you breathe in,
roll your back down to the floor again. It will be a fairly fast movement
as you roll up and down. Your hips can flex, so that your knees will
move forward as you lift up. Then let the knees move away from you
as you roll down, and allow your elbows to straighten. If your lower
back feels stiff and clunky, try using soft padding underneath and
take only tiny movements. If it still doesn’t feel good, or feels too
explosive for your comfort, practise Prayer Sweeps instead.

2 .  Now slow the movement down, to build on your core control.
Lengthen your arms along the floor, palms down. Pressing down with
the palms, inhale and lift up your sacrum, possibly lifting the hips
higher this time and working a little further up the spine. If you feel
strong in your core and flexible in your forward bends, you will be
able to work with straight legs, as shown; but if you need to bend the
knees, that works well, too.

3 .  Now start to roll back down, using your palms against the floor to
help slow this movement down. Exhale, draw your navel toward the
spine and take your legs slightly away from vertical. Each time you
repeat, take your legs a little further toward the floor. If you are
unable to scoop your belly in, that’s a sign you have gone too far:
either bend your knees or don’t lower so far, or both. Most people
keep their legs closer to vertical than horizontal in this practice. The
aim is not to have your legs hovering above the floor, which is super-
difficult. It’s more important that your core works correctly here than
insist on large movements. Complete ten rounds, then rest.

1 .  Start in Classic Downward-Facing Dog Pose . To get started on the
pelvic-tilt action, bend your knees and lift up onto tiptoes. Now tuck
your tailbone under to a pelvic tilt. You will feel your lower back
lengthening out and your abdominal muscles squeezing. Throughout
this sequence you can continue to initiate the pelvic rotation with bent
knees, if you have tighter hamstrings; but if your hamstrings are quite
flexible, try it out with straight legs, as shown.

2 .  Move your hips forward into the Plank position, with shoulders over
wrists. As you come into this pose, move from your hips first and
finish at your neck. You’ll create a ripple-like action as you move from
bottom to top. It might help to mentally divide your spine into small
segments of a few vertebrae each. Assisted by the abdominal
muscles, each vertebral chunk will briefly lift toward the sky, even as
your overall shape lowers to form the straight line of a plank. Perform
this action on an inhalation and breathe slowly, so that you have
plenty of time.

3 .  Once you are in the Plank position, exhale and lift your navel away
from the ground. With the abdominals firmly drawing in, take your
hips up and back into Downward-Facing Dog once again. Allow for a
nice long, slow exhalation, so that your heels have time to ease down
toward the floor for a good calf stretch.
4 .  Now set up your flowing movement, the speed of which will be
guided by your breath. Inhaling, tilt your pelvis backward and ripple
the movement up your spine into the Plank position. Exhale, squeeze
on the abdominals and move to Downward-Facing Dog. Repeat six to
ten times, then rest.

1 .  From the Classic Downward-Facing Dog Pose , inhale and lift your
right leg into a high Dog Split. Press down through both palms and
reach away through the ball of the right foot.

2 .  Exhale to start to move your torso forward to a Plank position, with
shoulders above wrists. As you do so, bend your right knee into the
breastbone, as if you wanted to kiss it. Lift your abdomen strongly up
and away from the earth. At the same time lift your chest, so that
your thoracic spine rounds upward. As you lift your vertebrae, allow
your shoulder blades to spread, and press down firmly through the
fingertips.

3 .  Exhale and, moving with a strong core focus, send your right leg
back and up as you take your hips into the Dog Split. Inhale, suck in
the abdominals again and return to the Plank position, this time with
your right knee moving toward your left armpit, so that you create a
rotation and enhance your oblique muscle strength.

4 .  Exhale, keep your abdominals engaged and lift back up to Dog
Split. On your next inhalation, come forward to the Plank position
once again, this time taking your right knee wide to the outer upper
arm on the right side. Exhale to return to your Dog Split, then lower
your right foot down. Rest, and circle your wrists to ease them. Then
practise the second side.

Seek advice before practising these postures if you have any pain in your hip joints or
any muscular or soft-tissue discomfort. Work with an experienced teacher for
modifications, if you have arthritis or a limited range of motion.

If there is anything guaranteed to have you feeling slinky and
supple as you walk – or sashay – out of yoga class, it’s a good
hip-releasing sequence.
Being ball-and-socket joints, your hips have an amazing
range of motion, but if you have a sedentary lifestyle, you
might not be fully utilizing their capabilities. If your daily life
involves lots of desk-time during work hours, slouched couch-
time after work and seated commuter-time in between, then
this could be the most life-enhancing section for you.
Hip stretches can help correct spine and pelvic
misalignments, and relieve back pain, soreness and general
stiffness. Aim to stretch all around your hip joint by practising
some wide-legged inner-thigh stretches and lunging-style
releases for the fronts of your hips, and by releasing those
tight rotator muscles at the buttocks and outer hips.
There are plenty of other gorgeous hip releases throughout
this book: do be sure to check out the “Yin Yoga” section, too,
for some stunners. With lots of tissue layers around the hips,
you want to take a little time, so don’t rush through the poses.
Stay for at least a minute in each one. Linger and love the
lusciousness of feeling light, free and floaty.

1 .  Start on all fours. Move your right knee wide, to point out to the
right, and bring your right toes to the centre, in line with your tailbone.
2 .  Take your left leg out to the left. Position your left foot so that both
heels are in one line. Arrange your left foot mindfully. Have all your
left toes pointing forward. Now focus on pressing down evenly on all
four corners of your foot: the big-toe knuckle, the little-toe knuckle,
the inner-heel edge and the outer-heel edge. Resist the urge to roll
your foot in, collapsing the inner arch. Instead, enliven the workings
of your foot and keep your inner arch lifted. Come down onto your
forearms with your hips in the air. If possible, slide your left foot
further to the left to find a satisfying and manageable stretch along
the inner thigh.
3 .  Keeping your buttocks high in the air and roughly in line with both
heels, walk your hands forward and allow the heart centre to open
toward the floor. Rest your forehead on the floor and, with palms
placed as far forward as possible, lift both elbows. Enjoy the
sensations of length in your torso and of release in your shoulders.
Think of dropping your armpits down lower, while energizing your
elbows so that they lift higher. Just as in the Classic Downward-
Facing Dog Pose , press all the knuckles of your fingers and thumbs
evenly into the floor. Stay for five to 15 long, smooth breaths. Then
come out, ready for side two.

1 .  Stand with your feet about 1.2m (4ft) apart. You can step wider if
you are taller, or go narrower if you are more petite or feeling stiff in
your body. With both legs straight, rotate at your thighs to turn your
toes out. Bend your left knee, sliding it over the smaller toes of the
left foot. Take both hands to the left knee for extra support. At this
stage, check that your left knee hasn’t crept forward of your left
ankle. If it has, that’s a sign you can widen your feet further apart.
Once you have your spacing, inhale to straighten up, then exhale to
bring your hands to the right knee, as you bend and direct your right
knee out wide. Turn this into a flow for five to ten rounds. Move from
side to side. If you like, use the smooth Ocean Breath to inhale up to
centre and exhale to alternate sides.

2 .  Once you feel warmed up, and if your knees are feeling good, take
it a little lower and deeper. Bring your fingers to the floor as you drop
your seat down, aiming for your left sitting bone to hover above your
left heel. Lift your left heel. On the right side, lift your toes and press
the heel of the right foot away to increase the inner-thigh stretch.
While easing into this hip-opening action, firm the back muscles along
the spine. This will help you to lift your torso up as tall as possible.

3 .  Once you have the upward lift in the torso, join the palms together
in prayer and, once again, draw yourself upright so that you feel as
tall as possible. You may be able to drop your left heel to the floor.
Exhale away any tightness in the hips or inner right thigh. After five
long, round breaths, draw up your pelvic-floor muscles and use the
strength in your legs to come up and move into the right side.

1 .  Sit with your legs stretched out wide. Bend your knees up a little,
to allow your pelvis to tilt forward enough to enable you to sit up tall
with less effort. Notice how the most central part of your two sitting
bones connects with the earth. Begin to circle your torso above your
hips. Sway to the right side of your sitting bones, then move slowly
forward, so that you feel yourself on the front edges of your sitting
bones. Continue your circle left and lean back a little, to start to
involve your abdominal muscles more. Continue to move in larger
and larger circles, until you feel that your arms want to get involved,
too. Reach your hands out to one side as you sway to that side, then
in front as you move forward. Each time you lean back, bend the
elbows to bring your hands closer to your chest.

2 .  Once the circling has freed up your pelvis somewhat, straighten
your legs and continue in ever-increasing spirals. If you are very
flexible and want more anchoring, reach the heels away and press
the backs of your knees to the floor. Ensure that you lean well into
the back of your circle, to engage your core muscles.

3 .  After ten or more spirals, change direction. This time start off with
your largest circles. After a few generous circles with no flat edges,
reduce the circumference bit by bit. Move in smaller and smaller
spirals until, after many rounds, you find yourself sitting still. Rest
your hands on your thighs. Once you have found your still centre,
above the axis of your pelvis, notice how your torso lifts and your
posture may feel long and dignified. While your outer body is now in
stillness, notice how your inner body may still feel a little swirly. Your
brain might even feel more relaxed by now. Relax into these
sensations as you enjoy your breathing for a little longer here.

1 .  Sit on the floor with your legs bent up in front. Reach your right
hand under your right thigh to take hold of your left ankle. Pull your
foot through to rest by your right outer hip. Grasp your right ankle in
your left hand and lift that leg up and over, to position your right foot
near your left outer hip. As best you can, stack your right knee on top
of your left knee. If that’s not possible for you, stretch out your left
leg in front and position the right leg on top, with the foot near the left
outer hip and the knees stacked as much as possible.

2 .  Interlace your fingers to cup your top knee. Start to circle your
torso above your hips – find a speed that feels nice. While it appears
externally that your hips don’t move, as you circle, become pleasantly
aware of the various lines of stretch that you feel. Let the circling
action dissolve the tensions bit by bit. After eight or more rounds,
circle the other way. Notice any tight spots and how much they, too,
release.

3 .  Come to stillness. Take both arms out wide and, rotating from the
shoulders, turn your thumbs forward and down and back. Bring your
palms together behind your back in reverse prayer. If you can’t get
your fingers to point up, have them pointing down. It’s easier still to
hold each forearm with the opposite hand. Inhale and draw yourself
up tall. Then exhale and, folding from the hips, tip forward. First, aim
to close the gap between your belly and thigh. Next, reach your heart
centre beyond the top knee – imagine your heart is full of runny
honey, and aim to drizzle it over the front of the knee. Create a line of
energy from your tailbone along the spine and out through the crown
of your head. With your right leg on top, you’ll feel the main stretch in
the right buttock. Hold for eight full, deep breaths. Then repeat on the
other side.

1 .  From an all-fours position, slide your left knee forward to your left
wrist. Move your left foot toward your right wrist. Now slide your right
leg straight back as your hips lower toward the floor. Square your
hips off as much as possible, by easing the right hip forward. Curve
your spine into a long, sloping backbend. This is your starter Pigeon
Pose. If you are fairly flexible, ease your left knee further to the left
and edge your left foot further forward. Your right foot and knee may
even be in one line. Continue to press your right hip forward. If your
hips are tighter, position your front leg so that your your knee is
further forward than your front foot.

2 .  If you experience knee pain, try using the support of a bolster or
folded blankets under the front thigh, to lift the hip higher than your
knee. It can be helpful to place each hand on a yoga brick, too. If you
still have knee pain, discontinue this pose. If you are comfortable,
move into the active assisted stretch. Keep both knees on the floor,
yet contract your muscles as if trying to slide your back knee forward
and your front knee backward. Use about 30 per cent of your muscle
power and contract for six seconds. Your basic position won’t
change, but your hips will float up slightly. Then release the
contraction and, on an exhale, soften everything, allow your hips to
drop and slide your back leg further away. Hold the stretch for 30
seconds, then reduce the intensity to rest for 30 seconds. Once
again, contract your muscles at only 30 per cent intensity, as if to
slide your knees toward each other, for six seconds, then release.
Slide your legs away, to stretch into the left buttock and the front of
the right hip for 30 seconds. Then use your hands to help you come
out, ready for the second side.

1 .  Lie on your back and bring your legs into the air. With both knees
bent, cross your left thigh in front of your right thigh. Take your hands
to the top shin and hug both knees in, for five or more long breaths.

2 .  Keeping your legs crossed, take your feet to the floor. Lift your
buttocks off the floor, to move your hips 5cm (2in) to the left side.
Then lift your legs and use your abdominals to bring your thighs in as
close as possible to your torso. With arms spread wide, lower your
legs to the right. If the floor feels too far away for comfort, place
cushions underneath, so that the stretch on the lower back is not as
intense. Choose a comfortable position for your neck. You may prefer
looking right, up, left or anywhere in between. Stay for eight or more
breaths.

3 .  To come up safely, unwrap your legs and bring them up one by
one. Then wrap them up the same way as before, left thigh on top of
right. Take your feet to the floor, lift your hips to move them 10cm
(4in) to the right (so that you have returned to spinal symmetry and
then moved 5cm/2in to the right of that centre position). Draw the
thighs in again, raising your feet into the air, and then lower them to
the left side. This side will be more challenging, so be open to taking
some support under the legs on this side. Relax into this position as
you broaden across the upper back and soften your right shoulder to
the floor. Settle on a good position for your neck, ensuring it feels
comfortable. Stay for eight breaths or more. Unravel your legs to
come up. Practise the second side, with your right thigh stacked on
top of the left.

Energizing, rejuvenating, invigorating, uplifting, revitalizing –
backbends offer all of these wonderful things. The list sounds
like a magic elixir that we wish we could bottle. We can’t bottle
it to sell, but the good news is that backbends are within your
grasp, if you are willing to put in the time.
We all need a balance between suppleness and strength.
Some backbends are stretch-based, while others are more
strength-based. Despite their caffeine-like boosting effects,
backbends are not like that favourite coffee you are stuck on –
a little variety is good. When choosing your backbend blend for
the day, it is vital to practise at least one that strengthens the
muscles, as well as another that targets flexibility.
Backbends undo the generalized slouching and hunching of
our modern-day, desk-based, TV-binging, commuter and
computer-bound lives. They are important for good posture
and more. Energetically, backbends elevate the chest and
allow us to greet the world with an open heart. And isn’t that
what our world needs so badly?

1 .  Lie on your front, with your hands palms down under the
shoulders. Line up your fingertips with the tops of your shoulders.
With your fingers spread apart, your longest finger will point straight
ahead. However, if you have muscly or stiff shoulders, you may like
to swivel the palms out, so that your index fingers point forward. Your
elbows will be in the air. Rather than allowing them to splay apart,
draw them toward each other, as if they were long-lost lovers.
2 .  Turn your attention to your left shoulder. In a large circular action,
drop your shoulder down, move it forward and up toward your left
ear, then complete the circle back and down, drawing your left
shoulder blade toward the waist. Your left shoulder will now be lifted
higher and will be nicely set back, compared to your right.

3 .  On your next inhalation, press through both palms to lift your chest
into Cobra Pose. Keep your elbows bent. On an exhalation, lower
down, forehead to the floor. Now focus on your right shoulder. Inhale
to circle it forward, up, back and down, letting the shoulder blade
glide down over the back of the ribs. On the same inhalation, lift up
into Cobra, keeping the back of your neck long. Exhale to slowly
lower down. Return to your first shoulder, inhaling as you first circle it,
then lift. Exhale down. Continue for several more rounds, alternating
shoulders as you lift on your inhalations and lower on your
exhalations. Enjoy your shoulder joints softening and opening.

4 .  To finish, work symmetrically. From the low position, roll both
shoulders back and down, then draw the bottom edges of your
shoulder blades toward each other. Reach out through the crown of
the head as you move your chestbone forward and lift up to your
Cobra. Hold for five to ten breaths. Then lower down to rest.

1 .  Lie face-down and make a pillow with your hands, with one flat on
top of the other, palms down. Place your forehead on your hands.
Make sure you can breathe through your nose comfortably, by
drawing your chin in.

2 .  Prepare for the lift-up by anchoring your pubic bone to the floor in
a slight pelvic-tilt action. Draw your navel into your body, as if to
lighten the weight of your abdomen on the floor. Press the tops of
your feet to the floor. Firm your kneecaps to create super-straight
legs, and energize just the kneecaps away from the floor. Now you
are ready to inhale and lift up your chest and arms. Keep your
forehead touching your top hand to maintain the length in the back of
the neck.

3 .  As you exhale through the mouth, curve your spine to the right as
you sweep your upper body to that side. Reinforce your lift, to keep
an even height through each side. Resist lowering the side that you
sway toward. Inhale through your nose to return to centre, then
exhale and glide your upper body to the left. Continue for ten more
rounds, inhaling to centre and exhaling to alternate sides. Once you
find your flow, and if your back is feeling good, speed up a bit. Make
your exhalations strong and fairly fast, and allow each sideways sway
to reflect that, too, so that they become strong, firm and focused
movements that build heat in your back. As you breathe and glide,
maintain the anchoring-down of the pubic bone and feet. At the same
time, draw your kneecaps and your abdomen away from the floor.

1 .  Lie on your front and, making a pillow with the backs of your
hands, turn your head to the right. Slide your right foot away a little,
then lift your right leg up in the air. Keep extending out along the
length of the leg to the toes, as you lift your right hip and sway your
raised leg to the left. Lifting the right hip will allow your hips to stack,
one on top of the other. Keep your raised leg roughly parallel to the
floor. While you enjoy five to ten steady breaths in this position,
develop a radiation of energies out through the right elbow. With a
squeezing action, slide your elbow wider to the right and further
forward. You might enjoy a pleasant sense of release in the
abdomen. Once you have finished, come out and practise the
second side.

2 .  Now straighten your arms out wide, palms down and level with
your shoulders. Turn your face to the right. Again slide your right leg
away, then lift it up and sway it over to the left. Once again, stack
your right hip above the left. Now bend your right knee and see if you
can catch your right foot in your left hand. Press your foot against
your hand so that it moves away from your buttocks, to increase the
backbend. Use your hand to guide the back foot up toward the line of
your shoulders, too. At the same, time deepen the backbend by
“anchoring” yourself more – press your right hip forward, to help
open more through the front of the right thigh. Stay for five to ten
breaths. Then repeat on the second side.

1 .  Lie on your front, with your arms stretched forward and shoulder-
width apart. Rest your forehead on the floor and magnetize your chin
toward your throat, to ensure you can easily breathe through your
nose. To come into the Half-Frog Pose, bend your right knee and
reach back with your right hand to grasp the front of the foot. Ease
your heel toward your buttock and, if it touches, move the foot to the
side to allow the right heel to scrape past the right hip toward the
floor. Lowering the heel will occur best if the right buttock is relaxed,
so soften it as much as possible. As backbends usually require the
activation of the buttocks, it can take a little practice to allow these
muscles to release. Once the right foot drops low enough, you may
be able to swivel on the heel of the hand so that the right fingers first
move out to the right and then point forward, as shown in step 2.
This will give a good stretch through the front of the shoulder.

2 .  Now enliven the left half of your body with Half-Locust Pose. Press
the top of the left foot down onto the floor. Lift your left kneecap off
the floor as you activate the muscles around the knee to keep it
straight. Squeezing on the muscles of the back, lift up your chest. Let
your left hand slide toward you, as the chest, shoulder and elbow lift
away from the floor. Rather than placing any pressure on the left
hand, ensure that all the hard work is being done with your back and
the anchoring left-leg muscles. Maintain the sense that you could lift
your left hand in the air without causing your chest to drop.

3 .  Stay for a few breaths, appreciating the half-and-half nature of the
pose – right side fairly relaxed, left side working hard. Then increase
the challenge by lifting your left leg in the air, reaching it away as if to
make space in the hip joint. Turn your left thumb upward and lift your
left arm up, too. While the left arm reaches away, keep the shoulder
blade drawing toward the waist, so that you don’t hunch. While your
left side is strong, your right side still has a softer energy to it,
continuing to allow the right heel to ease downward. Hold for five
deliberate and focused breaths. Then practise the second side.

1 .  Start by lying face-down on your mat. Reach back to grasp your
ankles. Roll your shoulders back, then inhale and press your legs
away as you lift your chest away from the floor. As well as pressing
back and away with your feet, lift them high. Create the largest
possible pocket of air between your back and legs. Press your
chestbone forward and up. Allow your belly to feel soft. Create a
long, full roundness along the front of your body and allow your chest
to lift high. If you are more flexible, you may experience a natural
rock forward on each exhale and backward on each inhale. Enjoy the
movements over five to ten long breaths.

2 .  Come down and rest your forehead on the pillow of your hands.
Bend your knees so that your feet sit above your knees, then sway
your feet both to the right, then both to the left a few times, like
windscreen wipers. If you can’t move on to the next stages, repeat
the first stage twice more, as each repetition should feel better.
3 .  Prepare to come up again. This time wrap your right hand around
the inside of your right ankle and grasp your left inner ankle with your
left hand. Inhale to lift up and enjoy the broadening of the collar
bones and the enhanced roll-back of the shoulders. Hold for five to
ten breaths once again. Then rest down.

4 .  For the final stage, reach your arms back and, crossing at your
wrists, swap ankles. Hold your right inner ankle in your left hand and
your left inner ankle in your right. Ensure that you have actually
crossed over at your wrists rather than your ankles. Each time your
breathe in, feel the expansion of your ribcage and soar skyward;
each time you breathe out, allow the abdomen to soften and relax.
After five to ten breaths come down and rest.

1 .  Start by lying on your front with your elbows bent toward your
waist. Tuck your tailbone under slightly, to lengthen the lower back.
Lift your abdomen away from the floor. You might like to imagine that
you are a belly dancer, with a large colourful gem in your navel. Lift
your precious stone away from the floor and at the same time press
your pubic bone down to the floor.

2 .  Lift your legs up and reach them back and away. Lift your chest
and get ready to free-flow. Try bending one knee to lift your toes
while you reach forward with the opposite arm, then move your limbs
the other way, so that your movements become a dance. In turn, lift
your limbs as high as they will go. Curve your spine left and right as
you sway your chest to each side. Think of how you might move as
you swim in the warm waters off a beautiful tropical beach. If you
like, reach back with one hand and hold the opposite leg, then use it
to float you higher.

3 .  Continue to stretch, sway and flow organically. When your back
feels warm from the healthy blood flow to all those back muscles and
you are pleasantly tired, stretch back into the Child Pose and enjoy
rounding the spine in this gentle opposite curve.

1 .  From all fours, bring your left knee close to your left wrist, and
your left foot a little toward your right wrist. Slide your right leg back
in a straight line, to come into a Pigeon Pose. It’s important to be
able to settle yourself toward the floor so that your hips can receive
the stretch. If your left buttock doesn’t touch the floor, support it with
a yoga block or folded blankets. You’ll need to be able to stay
grounded while lifting both hands up, without tilting sideways. If your
left buttock touches the floor, enhance the gluteal stretch by moving
your left knee further to the left and easing your foot further forward,
so that your shin is more perpendicular to your torso. Check that
your right ankle is directly behind your right hip, and that your right
knee is not bent out to the right. If it bends out, you need to lift your
seat higher, so grab some more padding.
When you are ready, bend your right knee. Grasp your right foot with
your right hand. Press your foot back against your hand and use this
action to sit your torso up taller, working deeper into your backbend.
Reach your left arm upward, palm up, and join the tips of your thumb
and index finger. Focus now on lifting up out of the lower back and
carving the concavity deeper into the mid- and upper back. Feel your
breath move into the front of your torso to help it broaden, lighten
and lift with each inhalation.

2 .  After five to ten breaths in the initial Pigeon Pose, move into the
Pigeon Crescent Pose. Bring your right foot in close to the body.
Twisting around to the right, draw your right foot in as close as
possible with your left hand. Now slip your right arm behind the right
ankle to nestle the foot into your elbow nook. Once you have secured
the foot, reach your left arm forward, up and back, to hook the
fingers of both hands together.

3 .  Once you are locked in, press the right side of your ribcage
forward to come out of the twist as much as possible. Press your
right foot back, so that you have a nice strong action to work against.
Use each inhalation to bolster the squeezing-forward of your right
side. At the same time, press your right foot back to develop your
backbend further. Hold for five long, smooth breaths. Then come out
and practise side two.

1 .  Kneel up, with your feet hip-width apart. Place your right palm on
your sacrum (the flat, bony plate halfway between your waist and
tailbone) and press lightly downward. At the same time, through this
whole sequence, remember to resist back a little with the sacrum into
the palm. Inhale and sweep your left arm forward and up to vertical.
As you do this, lift the chest higher. Consider the lifting arm as an
extension of your spine and allow its reach to lift you taller.

2 .  Keeping the ribcage lifting up out of the lower back, exhale and
take your left arm back to create your backbend. Press your thigh
bones forward, aiming to have them vertical. Inhale to lift your heart
centre, and return your left arm to vertical. Then exhale to lower it
forward and down, swapping hands so that your left palm is on your
sacrum. Inhale to sweep your right arm forward and up. Exhale as
you reach it back and curve into your backbend. Press your hips
forward. Inhale to lift up as symmetrically as possible, then exhale to
swap hands at your sacrum again. Continue for five more rounds,
going a little deeper as you warm up.

3 .  If you like, add a twist. Next time your left arm reaches up, look
down to the right, lean back and touch your right fingertips to your
left heel. Your toes can be tucked under or, for a greater challenge,
un-tucked, with the tops of the feet flat on the floor. Your left arm
continues to help elevate your spine. Hold for several breaths before
inhaling back up, ready to change sides.

4 .  Try the full classic Camel Pose, by taking both hands back to your
heels. Continue to lift through the centre of the chest and press the
fronts of your thighs forward, while your navel moves inward. Roll
your shoulders back and ensure that your neck is comfortable.
Lightly drawing your chin to your throat and then looking forward and
up a little works for most people.

1 .  Sit on the floor with your knees bent up. Position your feet hip-
width apart and check that the second toe of each foot points straight
ahead. Roll down to lie on the floor. Walk your feet back, so that each
foot sits just in front of your buttocks. Have your arms on the floor,
palms down, slightly out from your hips. Lift your hips up to form your
bridge shape. Tip to the right to take the weight off your left shoulder,
so that you can roll it under. Then tilt to the left to roll your right
shoulder under. Create a gulley of air space between your shoulder
blades. Work your leg muscles to maintain the height of your hips,
and move your chestbone toward your chin. Hold for five to ten long
breaths. Then come down to rest. Repeat twice more or move on to
step 2.

2 .  Bring your knees into your chest, grab the front of each ankle in
each hand and replace the feet on the floor, so that they stay in, nice
and close to the buttocks. Still holding onto your feet, lift your hips up
once again. Once you are up, roll to each side to roll one shoulder
under and then the other. Pulling against the ankles, lever your hips
higher up. Reach your breastbone toward your chin. Hold for five to
ten long breaths. Then come down to rest. Keeping hold of your
ankles, repeat twice more or progress to step 3.

3 .  Lift your hips up again. Lean to the right, so that your left shoulder
lifts off from the floor and, exaggerating that shoulder roll-back
movement even more, reach your left hand to hold your right ankle.
Then lower the left shoulder down to the floor. Using the leverage of
both hands gripping, reinforce the uplift of the chest and hips. The
right side of your ribcage will tend to droop, so re-double your lifting
efforts here. Make your torso as symmetrical as possible. Continue
to draw your shoulder blades toward each other behind your back.
Keep your thigh muscles working strongly to lift your hips up. After
five to ten breaths, come down again. Rest, then come up to work
with both hands holding the left foot.

1 .  Lie on your back, with your knees bent and feet hip-width on the
floor. Bring your palms to the floor beside your ears, fingers pointing
to the shoulders. Lift your hips, directing them upward and away from
your shoulders.

2 .  Catch the wave of an inhalation, press the palms into the floor and
lift up. You may notice your heels lift in the air. Keeping your hips
high, ease the heels down to the floor. If possible, walk them in
toward your hands to make your shape more circular. Straighten your
elbows as much as possible and move your chest forward, away
from your buttocks. Sometimes it’s easy to forget to breathe when
you are upside-down, so keep your breathing steady and regular. If
your toes have turned out, rearrange the feet by bringing the big toes
closer together, so that the second toes can point forward. After five
or more breaths, tuck your chin in and bend the elbows, to lower
down with control. Rest, then repeat two more rounds. Despite the
fatigue factor, each round will feel easier, as if the joints have been
better lubricated.

3 .  On the third round, if you feel ready, lift one leg. First, turn the left
foot out by 2.5cm (1in). Allow the left knee to move slightly to the left
as well. Firm the left buttock, ready to bear more weight. Activate
your abdominal muscles and bend your right knee as you lift your
right foot off the floor. Bring your right thigh in toward your belly,
keeping your knee well bent. Lengthen your right leg straight up, as
vertical as your flexibility will allow. Point the toes initially, then peel
your right toes back, so that the ball of the foot is the highest part of
the pose. Hold for five breaths. To come out, bend the right knee in
first, then lower the leg with control. Stabilize, then turn your right
foot and knee out 2.5cm (1in), ready to lift the left side.

1 .  Stand with your back to the wall. Measure out your spacing by
reaching behind to place one palm flat on the wall.

2 .  Turn to the front to take up your starting position. Have your feet
hip-width apart, aligned so that your second toes point forward. It’s
really important that your thighs work well in this sequence. Switch on
your front thigh muscles, so that they tighten and your kneecaps lift.
Ground down well through the feet, particularly the heels. Send a
message down to your heels to stay well anchored to the floor for the
entire sequence.

3 .  With your palms together at your heart, inhale and lift your
chestbone up toward your thumbs. Keep this lift while you exhale. On
your next inhalation reach your preferred arm up overhead and, as
you exhale, take your hand back to the wall. Don’t slouch into the
lower back – you want to create an “up and over” feeling with the
upper back, so be sure not to flatten the chest. Your legs will stay
strong and straight at this point, so keep working those thighs.

4 .  Reach up and over with your second hand, then begin to walk your
hands down the wall. You will soon need to bend your knees, and you
might need to walk your feet away from the wall a little.

5 .  Once you’ve walked all the way down, take your palms flat to the
floor into Upward-Facing Bow Pose . Have your feet as close to the
hands as possible, to make a smooth, high arch. Be as round as you
can, without over-compressing the lumbar spine or needing to lift
your heels. Push your palms into the floor to work the arms straight.
Try to keep your feet hip-width apart and your second toes facing
forward. To come out of this pose, tuck the chin in and lower yourself
down to rest on your back. Repeat twice more. If you can, take both
arms up and over at the same time in step 3. Work toward not
needing the wall.

U P S I D E - D O W N
It’s often beneficial to look at things from a different perspective,
and this is exactly what upside-down poses let us do. It’s fun
exploring any new yoga pose – there’s something about making a
new shape with your body that can shift you from being a serious
adult with deadlines and commitments to a more carefree you.
It’s a balancing thing, on more than just a physical level, to
build the confidence and strength to fully weight-bear through the
shoulders and arms. It tones muscles and builds flexibility, and
you’ll find that your heart pumps more. Besides building balance
and core strength, yoga inversions do double-duty by giving you a
workout plus a work-in .
Inversions are a boon for the digestive system, too. Our
abdominal organs get suspended for that short time, and our
organs of elimination seem to be given a little help. Inversions are
considered to strengthen digestion by returning agni (the digestive
fire energy) to the liver, gall-bladder and stomach – though you
may want to avoid inverting if you suffer from heartburn.
Inversions assist lymphatic circulation, which relies heavily on
gravity and muscle movement, therefore helping the immune
system. Some inversions, such as armstands and headstands,
are considered “heating” to the system, giving you energy. Others,
such as shoulder-stands and their follow-on poses, are considered
to be cooling postures, calming for the nervous system.
Yoga folklore bills inversions as anti-ageing. While there are
plenty of yoga practitioners who appear younger than their age, at
the very least an inversion will send a boost of fresh oxygen and
nutrient-carrying blood to your face – so I can promise you a
pleasant flush.
Do read through the “cautions on inversions ”. If you are in any
doubt, seek help from an experienced yoga teacher. If full weight-
bearing postures aren’t for you right now, there are lots of
achievable postures where the head is below the heart. There are
many Downward-Facing Dog varieties and standing forward folds
to be enjoyed.
C A U T I O N S  O N  I N V E R S I O N S
The headstand has been called the “father” of all postures, and
the shoulder-stand the “mother”. While these postures hold a
historically important place in Hatha yoga practice, do remember
that in the context of a modern lifestyle, these poses and their
derivatives may not be appropriate for you. Modern lifestyles
cause us to approach these poses from a sedentary starting
point. As you have moved around upright for most of your life,
weight-bearing by the head and neck needs to be built up slowly
and sensibly.
Shoulder-stand- and headstand-based postures should be done
when you are thoroughly warmed up, after a full-spectrum
practice.
Begin with the simpler starter options shown here, and initially
hold them for just a few breaths. This way your body can offer its
own feedback over the next 24 hours, before you practise again.
Even if you feel you have a strong, well-prepared body, be ready
to leave any ego aside. It might be that certain versions of these
poses don’t suit you right now. It’s possible to practise with good-
looking form – possibly using various props and alignment tweaks
– yet still notice that these poses don’t suit you perfectly. In this
case, work with an experienced teacher.
T O  I N V E R T  O R  N O T  T O  I N V E R T ?
Avoid inversions if you have degenerative conditions of the upper
body, any concerns about current or previous neck injuries or
pains, shoulder aches, weakness, excess tightness or imbalance.
Seek advice first from a professional in cases of a slipped
(herniated) disc or any inflammation of the back. Avoid upside-
down postures if you have a severe heart condition, high blood
pressure, glaucoma, a detached retina, inner-ear discharge or
severe sinus infection. Don’t practise while you have a headache.
Seek further advice if you have osteoporosis: you could develop a
strategy around inversions with an experienced teacher.
It’s not recommended to invert during menstruation. Going
against the natural direction of flow can slow down the body’s
process of elimination. During pregnancy, it’s possible to practise
headstands and shoulder-stands during the first and second
trimesters (but never after 35 weeks), as long as you have had
regular practice of them to date. However, many pregnant women
find the desire to invert drops away during pregnancy, so feel free
to give these dramatic-looking poses a miss for the duration. If
you do want to continue during pregnancy, you need to be able to
lift up your legs with graceful control, without jolting at all. For the
headstand and tripod balances, stay at the wall, so that there is
no risk of you toppling over.

1 .  Fold three large blankets to 80 x 50cm (30 x 20in) and about 10cm
(4in) thick. Place your blanket stack with the wide side parallel to the
wall. It should be about 25cm (10in) from the wall, or a little further away
if you are very tall. To come into position, sit side-on to the wall, with
your left hip and shoulder touching it. One buttock will be on the blankets
and the other hovering above the floor. Lean back on both hands and
swivel on your seat as you lift your legs up the wall.

2 .  Lie yourself back, to bring your legs together up the wall. Now double-
check your position on the blanket. It’s not necessary to have your
buttocks touching the wall. What is important is that your head is on the
lower level and your shoulders are on the upper level. Ensure that your
shoulders are 5cm (2in) from the edge of the blanket. Roll to the side to
come out, if necessary, and tweak the blanket distance. Once you have
it right, look down the front of your body to check that your heels, pubic
bone and throat centre are all in one line. This posture, with or without
the blanket, is called Viparita Karani . It’s a little bit magical, with its
restorative effects, and some days it’s enough to rest here for ten to 20
minutes.

3 .  To continue to your Starter Shoulder-Stand, slide your feet down the
wall and bend your knees to about 90 degrees. Press your feet to the
wall to lift your hips up. Proceed carefully and check how your neck is
feeling. It’s important that it doesn’t feel stretched taut, and it should
always feel comfortable. Take your palms to your lower back.

4 .  Walk your feet up the wall to straighten your legs. Bearing more
weight through your wrists, detach one foot from the wall, then the other,
to reach your legs straight up. Congratulations: you are in Shoulder-
Stand.

5 .  Continually check that your neck is still feeling comfortable. If you feel
that your neck is too flexed for comfort with your legs more to the
vertical, fold at your hips to bring your feet forward and your hips back.
Start by holding for half a minute, then build up with repeated regular
practice over the weeks and months to a five-minute hold.

1 .  Position yourself on the blanket stack so that your shoulders are
about 8cm (3in) away from the edges, with your head on the lower level.
Bend your knees and place your hands, palms down, beside your hips.
Press down on your palms and contract your abdominal muscles to lift
your legs and hips up in the air. Keeping your knees bent, continue to
roll up the spine until your knees hover above your head. Bring your
hands to your sacrum. Keep looking straight up. Acclimatize here for
several breaths. Check that your neck is feeling fine. If so, proceed; if
not, come out.

2 .  Without turning your head to the side, tilt a little to your right to slightly
release the left shoulder. Roll it back, so that you get a good shoulder
tuck-under on that left side. Now weight-bear more through the left, so
that you can roll the right shoulder under, then return to symmetry. The
idea is to create a gulley between your shoulder blades and bring your
elbows closer together, which will allow your torso to lift up more.
Eventually your upper-arm bones will be parallel and your hands will be
able to walk down from your sacrum to hold your mid-back.

3 .  A bend at the hips with the legs at an angle and plenty of weight in
your hands is safest, while your body gets accustomed to regular
Shoulder-Stand practice. Once you have set up your foundation and are
feeling comfortable, you will be ready to lift your legs higher and will find
the angles that suit your body best. Move the chest to your chin, lift
more through the front of the torso and elevate the legs, so that the
whole shape is more vertical. Whatever your shape, remember that you
are getting all the great benefits of Shoulder-Stand, so leave the ego out
of it and choose whichever option truly suits your body best. Start with
holding for 30 seconds, then build up to five minutes with regular
practice. Over those five minutes you will need to make small
adjustments to maintain your lift and symmetry. Certainly do this, but try
not to fidget unnecessarily. Focus on lifting through long, straight legs,
on your breath and on your stillness. Then come out and practise the
Shoulder-Stand counterposes (see Neck Releases After Inversions ).

1 .  p l o u g h  p o s e . 
From Shoulder-Stand, fold at the hips and lower your legs overhead. If
you are flexible in your forward bending, you may be able to touch your
feet to the floor, toes tucked under. If you can’t touch down, continue to
support your back with your palms. In this case, allow your knees to
bend while the toes float. You can allow the spine to round softly in this
hovering position, which is more restful. However, if you can touch your
toes down, lift more through the spine to bring it a little more vertical, so
that the hips stack more over the shoulders. Then interlace your fingers
and reach your arms back along the floor. Your arms and shoulder line
will create a tripod of support, making a base from which to lift the torso.
This pose works using your three blankets initially; then with time and
experience, and if it suits your neck, you can reduce to none.
2 .  h a l f - l o t u s  p l o u g h .
From Shoulder-Stand, with the legs fairly vertical, rotate the left thigh
bone externally to turn your left leg out. Then bend the left knee and
bring your foot to the front of your right thigh. Use one hand to maintain
your lower back support, while you bring the other hand up to help
nestle your left heel into the right groin, or as close as possible on the
upper thigh. Once your foot is in place, lower your right leg overhead,
possibly bringing your right toes to the floor. Check there are no
messages of discomfort coming from your left knee as you do this.
Extend the arms away along the floor and interlace your fingers. Hold for
up to one minute, before returning to Shoulder-Stand to practise the
second side.
3 .  s p i d e r  p o s e .
This increases the forward bend and is only suitable if you are
comfortable in Plough Pose without blankets. Take the Plough Pose with
your toes touched down and your hands supporting your back. Walk
both feet to the left. Check that your neck is feeling comfortable. Slowly
lower your knees to the floor, just beside your left ear, and rest the tops
of your feet on the floor. Reach your arms away along to floor. Interlace
your fingers and press your arms down, to allow more lift through your
torso. Hold for five to ten breaths, then move into the second side.

1 .  Once you have come out of your inversion, lie flat on your back with
your knees bent up. If you are using blankets, move down so that your
head and back are on the same level. Come into position without
twisting your neck to either side, as it’s important to first release the
neck in a forward and backward direction. Press your chin in toward
your throat to flatten your neck toward the floor. Feel how the head
slides away from the shoulders to allow the neck to lengthen. Stay for
two breaths.

2 .  Next arch your neck vertebrae and slide the base of your skull toward
your shoulders slightly. Hold for two breaths. Then repeat the neck
flexion and extension movements several more times each.

3 .  Fish Pose is great to do after Shoulder-Stand. Lengthen your legs out
straight. Slide one hand under each buttock, palms down. Drawing the
chin toward the throat, lift up through the chest and come up to rest on
your forearms. You will be looking forward at this stage. Then take your
torso back as you lift your chin and let the crown of the head move
toward the floor. As the angle of your elbows increases, the crown of
your head may lightly touch the floor. Ensure that most of the weight is
borne by the forearms and lower body. Hold for five to ten breaths. To
come out, lift the head just enough to un-wedge it from the floor, and
lower yourself all the way down, to lie on your back. Hug your knees into
your belly and practise another couple of neck flexions (step 1) and
extensions (step 2).

4 .  After your neck releases, roll your whole body to the side, head
included. You still have not twisted the neck. Come up to sitting. Once
you are sitting, you can turn your head from side to side. Head-Beyond-
the-Knee Pose is one of my favourite postures to practise after
inversions.

1 .  Kneel and fold your torso forward into the Child Pose . Bring your
hands to the floor, shoulder-width apart, positioned with your fingers
roughly on the same line as the forehead. Lift your hips up as you roll
from your forehead to the crown of your head. Try to rest on the anterior
fontanelle – where the soft part at the top of a baby’s head is. Aim to
have the bones of your neck fairly vertical. If they are not, roll back
down to your forehead, then adjust by moving your forehead in closer to
your knees before coming back into the pose.

2 .  Now practise the correct setting of the shoulders. Slide your shoulder
blades toward your waist and lift the tops of your shoulders away from
the ears, so that they form a horizontal line. Have your upper-arm bones
parallel, so that your elbows point straight backward. This will let you
better control how much weight is on your head. Aim for it to take
around 20 per cent of the weight, but test the waters by doing less. Lift
your back to a high, rounded shape. After three to ten breaths, rest
back down to Child Pose or, if it feels right, proceed to the next stage.
3 .  Still pressing the palms to the floor and lifting the shoulders up and
away, roll down toward your forehead an inch or so. Then start to circle
around the crown of your head. Let your hips move sideways, back and
around, as you create slow circles. Enjoy this nice head massage. After
several loops, circle back the other way. After three more rounds, roll
down to Child Pose or, if you are ready, move on to the full posture.

4 .  With the weight once again through the crown of your head, interlace
your hands behind your back. Lift your arms to vertical or beyond, and
use this reach to lessen the pressure on the head a little. Stay for ten
breaths, then reposition the palms on the floor to help you roll down and
rest in Child Pose for a minute. When you are ready to sit up, roll up
through the spine so that the head comes into position last of all.

1 .  Take two strong identical chairs and position them by a wall, facing
each other. The seat edges should be about 16cm (6in) apart, just
enough for you to slip your head through, but narrow enough to support
your shoulders. Fold two matching blankets so that they create a broad
pad about 10cm (4in) high. Ensure they are exactly the same height, as
they will become your base. Slide your hands in under the pads, so that
the palms are resting on the seat of the chair. Your wrists will be near
the front of the chair.

2 .  Your chairs should be just wide enough apart for you to slip your head
in between them. Do this now, and position your shoulders about
halfway along the chair edge (deeper in than your wrists). Step your feet
away and let the whole top of your shoulder line rest on the padded
supports. Lift up to tiptoes and walk your feet in toward the chairs. At a
certain point you won’t be able to walk in anymore without bending your
knees. This is the place to kick up from. Lift one leg up as high as
possible.

3 .  Bend the other knee and, when you are ready, kick up that leg and
then the other (or, with experience, lightly float your legs up). Take both
heels to the wall. In time you can practise not touching the wall at all.
Once you are up, get as symmetrical as possible. It helps to have
someone stand back opposite you, to check your alignment. Keep your
breathing long and steady. Often the reason people come out of
inversions is not that they were physically unable to hold it for longer, but
because they forgot to keep breathing. Practise moving your feet away
from the wall, to free-balance. Stay for three breaths initially, building up
to a minute over repeated regular practice.

4 .  To come down, scissor one leg forward, toes tucked under, and land
lightly down. Once both feet are on the floor, step backward, releasing
the head from the chairs. Take a low squat or kneeling position for a
minute, until you are ready to come up.

1 .  Fold a yoga mat to form a large rectangle. Place it between you and
the wall, then kneel in front of it. Position your elbows on it shoulder-
width apart and interlace your fingers, about 20 cm (8 inches) from the
wall. Check that your wrists are vertical, with the thin edge facing up.
Press the underside of the wrist into the floor, so there is no rolling in or
out of the wrists. Place the back of your head into the arch created by
your hands. Ensure it’s the crown of the head that touches the floor, not
the forehead. While still kneeling, practise lifting your shoulders away
from the floor. Press down evenly through the forearms, creating a
triangle of support, while the shoulders lift up and away to encourage
minimal compression of the neck. When you can do this action, you are
ready to lift your hips and straighten your legs. If you lift your hips and
find that you can’t help your shoulders collapsing down, or your neck
comes out of its natural curve, then stop for now, until you build up your
flexibility and strength.

2 .  On tiptoes, walk your feet in until you can’t go further. This is the point
where you feel the readiness to lift. Your shoulders and hips will be lined
up above your ears. Continue to press the forearms down and the
shoulders up. Firm your abdominal muscles.
3 .  Bend your knees to allow your feet to float up. Bring your knees in
toward your abdomen. Aim for the arms to take 70 per cent of the
weight and the head just 30 per cent. Stabilize here.

4 .  If you feel steady, come all the way up. “Unfold” your legs by first
pointing your knees upward, so that your heels are near your buttocks.

5 .  Now straighten your legs in the air. Start with a 30-second hold.
Before you build up to longer holds, seek advice from a qualified teacher
who can check your alignment. Once you are up, ensure your hips stay
symmetrical. Keep your shoulders working away from the ears, to limit
the weight on the head, and press the floor away with your arms. Extend
through the feet, to keep the sense of lift. When you are strong here you
will feel lighter. To come down, reverse the steps you took to get up: fold
at the knees, then hinge at the hips to bring your toes to the floor lightly
and with control. Rest in the Child Pose for a full minute.

Avoid Headstand if you have concerns about current or previous neck injuries, pains,
headaches, shoulder aches or excess tightness. Avoid inversions if you have eye issues
such as a detached retina or a risk of glaucoma. Extra care must be taken during
pregnancy, so make sure to work with an experienced teacher.

1 .  h e a d s t a n d  s p l i t  t w i s t .
From a stable Basic Headstand , scissor your legs so that your right leg
goes forward and the left goes back. As you do this, each hip will move
toward its leg, coming a little out of its starting point of horizontal
alignment. Ensure the back leg remains straight, and do your best to
ease it down as low as your front leg. Now move into the twist by
sending the right leg to the left. Once you have twisted, return your
attention to your legs. Internally rotate both thighs. Then energize both
legs away from each other, by reaching out through the balls of the feet
while fanning the toes back toward the midline. Hold for up to a minute,
before lifting back up to Headstand, ready for the second side.
2 .  o n e - l e g g e d  h e a d s t a n d  s p l i t .
From a steady Basic Headstand position, extend upward through the
right leg. Rotate the left leg outward, so that the toes point to the left.
Lower the left leg out to the side, possibly as far as touching the toes to
the floor and pressing the left heel away. Continue to lift the shoulder line
away from the floor. Lighten the amount of weight on the head by
keeping an even pressure through left and right forearms and pressing
down. Maintain the internal thigh rotation of the right leg, reaching it up
and away. After five to ten breaths, lift your left leg, stabilize, then
practise side two.
3 .  h e a d s t a n d  c r u n c h e s .
This variation will really wake up the abdominal muscles. From your
Basic Headstand, exhale to lower both straight legs and hover the feet
just above the floor. You are using your legs as resistance for your
abdominal muscles to work against. As you do this, your hips will move
backward from their starting alignment over the shoulders. Inhale as you
hold the legs low, then exhale and lift them to vertical. Inhale once you
are upright, then exhale to lower again. The slower you go, the more
strengthening this is, as you are not relying on momentum or gravity.
Repeat for up to ten rounds, paying attention to the strength in your
shoulders and maintaining their lift. Remember: in Headstand most of
the weight should be on the forearms and hand edges, not on the head
itself.

1 .  To measure out your spacing, sit with your back to a wall and check
where your heels come to. Then come to all fours and place the heels of
your hands at the point where your heels were. Position your hands
shoulder-width apart, with the fingers spread wide. Press down evenly
through the knuckles of all the fingers. Once the knuckles are anchored,
exaggerate the pressing of the pads of the fingers into the floor. These
actions will help to keep your wrists safe.

2 .  Tuck your toes under and lift your knees, so that you are in an
inverted V-shape. It will feel like a shortened Classic Downward-Facing
Dog Pose , with your hands a little closer to the feet than usual. With
both knees up, take one foot to the wall. While you press the foot into
the wall, lift your second foot to the wall and walk it up a little higher than
the first.

3 .  Position both feet at hip height, so that your legs are parallel. Press
the floor away with your palms. Keep your abdominal muscles engaged,
to help you hold this steady. It is actually easier to walk your feet higher
up, so you can take that option while you build strength.

4 .  Get more of the upside-down feeling by taking one leg up to vertical.
Reach up through that leg to press the sole of the foot as high as
possible. Remember your breath – often, it’s running out of air that will
make you come down early. Build up your time in Starter Handstand to
up to a minute. Once you are done, walk your legs down the wall to
bring your feet to the floor again. Bend the knees and come to rest in
Child Pose , arms by your side. Then sit up and circle your wrists in both
directions.

1 .  Kneel in front of a wall and position your hands shoulder-width apart,
so that your fingertips are about 15cm (6in) from the wall. Spread your
fingers wide, and even out the pressure between the inner and outer
palms by pressing your thumb side down a little more. Tuck your toes
under and lift your knees, so that you come to a Classic Downward-
Facing Dog Pose . Walk your feet in toward your hands. Bring your
shoulders above your knuckles and lift your hips as high as you can.
Lift one leg in the air as high as possible. If you feel you can maintain
the strength and the lift in the shoulders, you are ready to kick up. If you
feel you might collapse, then this is far enough for today. Instead,
continue practising Downward-Facing Dog, the Plank position and
general shoulder-stretching poses, to get ready over time.
2 .  If you are ready to kick up, bend both knees. Contract your abdominal
muscles to prepare to lift, as they will help the journey skyward. Use the
lower leg to give a strong, confident kick, so that you can float both legs
up as you straighten them. Once the top leg touches the wall, your
second leg will follow on and both heels will touch the wall. Keep your
abdominal muscles activated, so that over time you can bring one leg –
and then both – away from the wall to free-balance. Hold for up to a
minute, then scissor your legs to come down. Bend your knees to the
floor and take your hips to your heels, to rest in Child Pose . When you
sit up, circle your wrists in both directions to release any strain.

1 .  Kneel in front of a wall and bring your elbows to the floor, no wider
than your shoulders. Have your index finger pointing forward, about
10cm (4in) from the wall. Adjust your forearms so that they are parallel,
then spread the fingers and root down, particularly through the inner
wrists and thumb knuckles. This will prevent the thumbs from sliding
toward each other, which tends to happen here.

2 .  Tuck the toes under and lift the knees to come into an inverted V-
shape. On tiptoes, and with the knees bent, lift up from the shoulders,
so that the crown of the head passively lifts away from the floor. As your
shoulder muscles work, develop your shoulder flexibility by moving your
armpits in and up toward the fronts of your thighs. Aim to create a
straight line from your elbows through your shoulders to your hips. If
your head is on the floor, you need to develop your flexibility (with
Pyramid Prayer ) and your strength (with Three-Legged Dogs ) before
progressing to step 3.

3 .  Walk your feet toward your elbows a little. Then realign again, by
lifting the shoulders away from the floor to create that clean line from the
elbow through the shoulder to the hip. Walk in again until you can’t walk
any more. This is your natural kicking point. Lift one leg up. Bend both
knees, then kick up while you straighten both knees. A strong,
committed kick up will take both legs together to the wall. At no time
during Forearm Balance will your head touch down on the floor – that’s a
sign to work on your flexibility some more. Each time you practise, keep
your body in balance by changing your kicking leg.

4 .  The next step is to move one foot, then both feet, away from the wall
to a free-balance. Once you are able to hold the full balance for one
minute, you can move 40cm (15in) away from the wall and practise
kicking up to the free-balance. When you do this, the leading leg will
momentarily come close to touching the wall, only to be immediately
counterbalanced by the trailing leg. Draw both legs together, contract
your core muscles and press the balls of the feet up to the sky, to
contribute to the lift that your shoulders are continually giving. Continue
to press the floor away actively with the forearms, inner wrists and
fingertips. Stay for up to 20 slow breaths, then scissor the legs to come
down lightly, with toes tucked under. Rest in the Child Pose .

1 .  Come into the Tripod Pose from hands and knees, with palms on the
floor shoulder-width apart. If you are not planning to drop into the Crow
Pose, you might practise just in front of a wall. Take the crown of your
head to the floor. It’s essential to pressurize your palms into the floor
and lift your shoulders up and away from it. This will provide better
support for the neck and reduce the weight-bearing load on the head.
Keep your arm bones parallel to ensure your elbows don’t splay apart.
With toes tucked under, lift your knees in the air and, with straight legs,
walk forward on tiptoes as far as you can, with the hips remaining high.
Now bring one knee to your upper arm, then do the same on the second
side.

2 .  You are now ready to squeeze your knees together, inhale and,
powering on your abdominal muscles, bring both legs straight up in the
air. Congratulations: you are now in your Tripod Pose, so breathe and
enjoy balancing there. Continue to lift your shoulders away from your
ears, and press down actively on the palms to lessen the load through
your head and neck.

3 .  Come into the Crow Pose. With your abdominal muscles on, bend
your knees to bring your heels toward your buttocks. Then, moving the
front ribcage into the body, fold at the hips to bring your knees toward
your torso. Next, lower your knees to wrap them around your upper
arms. Keep your toes lifted as you lower your hips. Bring your chest
forward, to lift your head off the ground in Crow Pose.

4 .  Preparing to come into your One-Legged Crow, seek to straighten
your arms as much as possible. Squeeze your arms toward each other
and lift your hips higher in the air. Draw up with your abdominal muscles.
Actively reach your right leg back and establish a counterbalance with
the chest, to shift your weight forward. Bring your extended knee back
to the arm, and practise the second side. If this is too challenging, start
instead with both sets of toes lightly on the floor and then extend a
single leg away in turn. This will give you a great sense of where you
need to stabilize, in order to be able to hold the full arm balance.

R E S T O R A T I V E  Y O G A
Restorative yoga is a category of poses where you position
your body in supported postures and then relax into them for
two to 20 minutes. You should feel no pain and there should be
minimal intensity. Your body is allowed to open gently. Some
parts of your body get to expand, while others get to
condense. You de-stress, because your “rest and restore”
nervous system can switch on, and your “fight or flight” stress-
based nervous system can clock out for the duration.
It sounds easy – too easy perhaps. And physically it is
pretty easy. Sometimes the real challenge lies in just letting go
of the thinking, and some people find this a little
confrontational, as the mind keeps ticking over. For this reason
I have given you a job to do on each page: “what to do while
you’re there”. It’s to keep the mind busy with something
wholesome, so that the rest of you get on with the job of
relaxing. Ultimately, your body will sleep and your mind will
simply watch.
If you have a chronic or recent injury, do seek guidance
before practising yoga poses. Otherwise, who does restorative
yoga suit? It suits those who are exhausted, tired, have trouble
sleeping or difficulty in letting go of control. It suits many
people who have a chronic disease, are under stress or may
experience stress in the future. It suits teenagers, university
students, parents, people who work, those who overwork and
those who don’t work. It suits grown-ups, whether you feel
young, old or very old. Are you getting my message? It suits
just about anyone who lives in the modern world.
Try out a complete practice once a week, following these
poses in the order in which they are presented. Or book-end
your active practice with a couple of these poses each time.

This softly supported hip-opening pose is delightful when you need to
re-centre.
1 .  Take two yoga bolsters or fold two blankets to form a wedge about
80 x 30 x 15cm (30 x 12 x 6in). Cross the two props to make a T-
shape, with the crossways bolster underneath. The top bolster will be
on an incline, to support your spine and form a pillow for your head.
2 .  Roll up a blanket to form a roll about 1.2m (4ft) long. Sit so that
your lower back is touching the end of the top bolster, and place the
soles of your feet together so that your knees bend out wide. Lift the
knees and wrap the blanket over your feet and tuck it in under your
ankles. Snake it up to your outer hips, so they are supported when
you drop your knees away from each other.
3 .  Lay your spine back on the top bolster. Your buttocks will be on the
floor; ensure that your sacrum is well supported by the bolster. Your
head will be higher than your heart, which in turn will be higher than
your hips. Lay your arms out to the sides, palms up and fingers softly
curled. If you are not perfectly comfortable, make adjustments as
required. Cover your eyes with an eye-pillow or light cloth. Stay for
five to ten minutes. To come out of the pose, use your hand to help
bring one thigh up and slowly roll out to the side.
b o u n d  c o b b l e r ’ s  p o s e
The belt gives a lovely traction to the lower back and allows deeper
work into the hips.
1 .  Sit with your back to a bolster, or blankets folded to form a pad
about 80 x 30 x 15cm (30 x 12 x 6in). Guide a soft yoga belt around
your lower back, above both inner thighs, over the ankles and under
the feet. Tie it up beside one ankle, so that the free end of the belt
extends toward your hips.
 
2 .  Leave the belt fairly loose as you lie back on the bolster. If you
need a pillow, use an extra folded blanket to support the head and
neck. Now tighten the belt by pulling on the band. Make sure it
provides even support around both hips, thighs and ankles. Rest your
arms out to the side and check that you feel warm, supported and
able to let your body go heavy and relaxed. Stay for five to ten
minutes.
w h a t  t o  d o  w h i l e  y o u ’ r e  t h e r e
To count yourself into a relaxed state: breathe in for a count of four beats, then exhale for
four beats. Do this for five or ten rounds, counting with your thumb against your fingers,
if you like. Then increase the timing to breathe in for five and exhale for five. After your
five or ten rounds, when it feels right, increase your counts to six. Continue lengthening
both inhalations and exhalations, through seven until you reach eight, where you will
have slowed your breathing rate by half. Reduce the count if it feels at all stressful or like
hard work – remember: the aim is to de-stress the system, not add more stress in.
t a k e  c a r e
Don’t stay in the pose if feels uncomfortable. Activate your stretched muscles before
you move to come out of the pose.

1 .  Fold up a blanket to form your pillow. It needs to be as high as the
distance from your shoulder tip to your ear – around 7–18cm (3–7in).
Take a yoga bolster or fold up a blanket to form a pad about 80 x 30
x 15cm (30 x 12 x 6in). Lay your left side over it, so that your buttock
comfortably touches the floor. Allow a gap of about 15cm (6in) for
your left shoulder to snuggle into, then place your pillow under your
head. Extend your left arm out in front, palm up. Check that you
haven’t pinned the left shoulder back and under. To relieve any
squashing, reach the armpit forward a little. Bring a soft bend into
your knees, so that you don’t have to worry about balancing. Take
your right arm up and over in line with your ear, to bring your palm to
a yoga brick or two offering a support 8–15cm (3–6in) in height.
Adjust for comfort and rest here for two minutes or more.

2 .  Move the brick backward by 12cm (5in) and take your right arm
back with it, so that your palm still rests on it. At this stage you are
still in a pure side-stretch, so don’t change the torso positioning. Stay
for two minutes, or more if you are loving it.

3 .  Now move the brick backward approximately another 25cm (10in).
This time you’ll bring your torso into a twist, so that your heart opens
more to the sky. Allow your face to turn upward just the right amount,
and turn your palm up, too. Adjust for comfort and stay for another
two minutes. Then turn around, ready to move through the three
stages on your right side. use your hand to help bring one thigh up
and slowly roll out to the side.
w h a t  t o  d o  w h i l e  y o u ’ r e  t h e r e
As you rest in each position, enjoy the way the inhalation seems to move more into the
top lung. If you are lying on your left side, let the right side of the torso swell with each
inhalation and visualize the right lung filling with fresh air, bringing good pranic energy
into your system. The left side of your torso will press down into the support with each
inhalation, so enjoy the massaging effects this has on the muscles of the left side.
Imagine that this slow, rhythmic massage is even soothing your organs, too.
t a k e  c a r e
Don’t stay in the pose if feels uncomfortable. Activate your stretched muscles before
you move to come out of the pose.

1 .  b a s i c  c h i l d  p o s e .
This version is most commonly used during active Hatha yoga
practice to take a rest break, either short or long.
Kneel with your knees together. Sit back on your heels and fold
forward to rest your forehead on the floor. Drape your arms beside
your legs, palms up. Allow your shoulders to roll in. Adjust as
required. Some people prefer their head turned to one side, in which
case do alternate between left and right. If your forehead doesn’t
touch the floor, try bringing your arms forward to make a little shelf
for your forehead with one or two stacked fists; again, let the
shoulders slouch happily.
2 .  s u p p o r t e d  c h i l d  p o s e .
This asymmetrical option helps reset the breathing to a slow and
steady rate, even long after your practice.
Kneel with your big toes touching and your knees wide apart. Take a
bolster or folded-up blankets between your thighs and lay your torso
down. Some people need two bolsters to keep the spine in a restful
horizontal line. To enjoy a passive release along the side of the torso,
reach your left arm forward, resting your forearm to the floor, while
your right arm drapes back. Turn your head to figure out which cheek
it feels nicest to rest on. Close your eyes and enjoy the sense of your
left lung inflating with fresh air, filling your torso with lightness. Stay
for one to five minutes, then change to side two.
3 .  e l e v a t e d  c h i l d  p o s e .
Enjoy feeling a lovely length through your front body, as you fill your
body with breath and light while relaxing to the max.
Fold a blanket to create a firm roll about 10cm (4in) thick. Place it
near the top of a bolster to form a T-shape. With feet together, but
knees wide, lay your belly and chest down on the bolster. Reach your
arms forward, to rest the area around your elbows on top of the roll.
Bring your forehead to rest on the edge of the roll. You want to
ensure that the height and position are right, so that your nose is
clear to breathe easily (with a light tucking in of your chin) and your
neck feels comfortable in the slightly flattened position. Placing the
forehead on a yoga brick placed in front of the roll works for many.
The heightened position of the armpits allows the shoulders to
release while your chest sinks deliciously into the bolster. Stay here
for a minute or ten!
w h a t  t o  d o  w h i l e  y o u ’ r e  t h e r e
Child Pose is a great opportunity to explore breathing into the different parts of the torso.
In all three of these Child Poses, movement of the breath into the front of your body is
restricted (by either the thighs or the soft support), offering the invitation to breathe into
the back of the body. Soften the back of the heart as your back muscles release with
each inhalation. Enjoy how the wave of each inhalation subtly increases the pressure on
the belly and chest, and sense how pleasant the reliable, soothing breath is as the
pressure on the abdominal organs gently increases and decreases like a soothing
massage.
t a k e  c a r e
Don’t stay in the pose if feels uncomfortable. Activate your stretched muscles before
you move to come out of the pose, and use your arm strength to bring you up.

1 .  Roll up a blanket to form a roll about 70cm (27in) long x 9cm
(3½in) high and place it crossways on the floor. This will go under
your back and is the most important element. If you have more props
handy, use them to add these next two elements. Take a bolster, or
roll up two more blankets to 15cm (6in) high, to place under your
knees. Take another blanket or large towel and roll it up to half the
height of your knee support, about 7cm (3in). This will go under the
Achilles curves, between your calves and heels.

2 .  Put your knee and ankle supports in place. Then lie down so that
the back roll is positioned at the midpoint of your ribcage, just under
the armpits. Take your arms out wide, palms up. If it feels better,
release more into the shoulders by taking them closer to the ears to
form a Y-shape. Your neck should feel long and graceful. If your chin
is in the air and your throat feels open and vulnerable, that’s a sign
that your neck is too arched. Either reduce the size of the back roll or
fold another blanket under the head to elevate it slightly. Hold for two
to ten minutes. Then remove the back roll and lie flat. Marvel at how
lusciously long and elegantly flat your back feels.
w h a t  t o  d o  w h i l e  y o u ’ r e  t h e r e
Practise the Rectangular Breath or, a little more challenging, Square Breathing: exhale
to empty the lungs, then inhale to fill them for a count of four. Hold your breath in for four
beats, then exhale to empty for four beats. Hold your breath out for a count of four. Do
three rounds in total; they can be consecutive or you can take some recovery breaths in
between. Then relax completely.
t a k e  c a r e
Don’t stay in this pose if it feels uncomfortable. Activate your stretched muscles before
you move to come out of the pose. Start with a shorter stay and extend it over several
practices. Don’t lie on your back in pregnancy after 14 weeks.

1 .  s i d e - l y i n g  s a v a s a n a .
As many of the muscles that help you breathe get a stretch, being
supremely supported in this pose, it means that your breathing can
slow and steady.
Start by lying on a soft surface on your left side. If you have plenty of
props, snuggle a bolster or rolled blankets alongside your spine.
Bend your right knee up level with your right hip. Support the leg from
the right knee to the foot with a bolster or more blankets, folded as
high as your right hip joint. Use a small cushion or folded blanket to
lift your head up, so that the neck follows the line and height of the
rest of the spine. Extend your right arm away behind you. Once you
know how high your right shoulder naturally sits, place blankets
folded to shoulder height under the entire length of the arm. Some
people won’t need any support under the back arm at all. Choose the
position for your neck and head that feels best for you. Rest for two
to five minutes. Then practise the second side.
2 .  s i m p l e  r e s t o r a t i v e  t w i s t .
So supportive, so soothing – let your body soak up the benefits of
this one.
Sit with a bolster (or blankets folded to a bolster shape) placed end
on next to your left hip. Bend your knees in, so that both feet are
near the right hip. Twist your torso to the left and place one hand on
either side of your prop. Push into the floor to increase the twist and
better line up your chestbone, which should be centred to the bolster.
Then slide the hands forward, to rest your chest and belly down on
the support. Check that your elbows are forward of the shoulders,
and wide enough to really allow the shoulders to slump in happy
relaxation. Try out which direction you prefer to face: forward or
back. Stay for up to five minutes. Then repeat on the second side.
3 .  r e s t o r a t i v e  e a g l e  t w i s t .
Enjoy the lovely outer hip and thigh release this twist offers.
Lie on your back with a bolster to your left, placed from hip to knee.
Bend both knees and wrap your right thigh around the left. If you
can, entwine the right foot behind the left calf. Place the feet on the
floor, lift your hips and move your buttocks 5cm (2in) to the right.
Then lift the feet up again. Activate your abdominal muscles and
slowly lower your legs to rest on the bolster. If this feels too strong,
raise the height of your support. If you have lower-back issues,
unravel your legs and rest them on the support, right leg on top of
left leg, with knees bent. Close your eyes and breathe here for two to
four minutes. Separate the legs before bringing them up one at a
time to get ready for side two.
w h a t  t o  d o  w h i l e  y o u ’ r e  t h e r e
Most twists, restorative or not, will tend to feel as if they close down the breathing a little
on one side. If you twist toward the left, the expansion of the left side of the ribs feels
constricted, as if you have to work harder to breathe deeply into that left lung. On the
other hand, it’s easy and natural to enhance the expansion on the right side. As you rest
in your twists, observe this phenomenon, and delight in expanding into the freer side.
When you come to the second side, the contracted side will have its turn, too, so it will
all even out for you.
t a k e  c a r e
Seek further advice before trying these restorative twists if you have any tendency
toward sacroiliac dysfunction, a slipped (herniated) disc or lower-back pain.

1 .  Position two bolsters so that they initially form one long line. If you
don’t have yoga bolsters, make two wedges using two to four
blankets each. How many you need will depend on their size and
thickness, and you may enjoy a higher wedge more if you need to
accommodate sore knees, tight hips or a heavier body. Fold up each
blanket to form a wedge approximately 80 x 30 x 15cm (30 x 12 x
6in).

2 .  Move the top bolster about 10cm (4in) to the left. Then make a
space between them of about 30cm (12in). Bring your right knee into
the space in between, and just out to the right side of the front
bolster. Take your right ankle close to the left side of the bottom
bolster.

3 .  Rest your left thigh, knee and shin on the bottom bolster. Slide
your left leg back and away, to lower your hips and find a gentle
stretch in your right buttock. Lay your torso down on the front bolster,
ensuring that it’s easy to relax your belly and chest into the softness
of the support. Take your elbows out wide, so that you can fully give
the weight of your forearms to the floor. Slide them slightly forward of
the shoulder line, to find the best shoulder release, and take them
wide. Turn your head in both directions to test which cheek you
prefer to rest on, or stay for half your allotted time on each. Close
your eyes and rest for five minutes before changing to the second
side. Keep warm with a soft cover, if required.

w h a t  t o  d o  w h i l e  y o u ’ r e  t h e r e
Practice bhramari (buzzing bee) breathing, to calm the nervous system: breathe in and
out through the nose and, each time you exhale, make a buzzing sound like a bee. This
will encourage your exhalations to lengthen out, in an incredibly restful way. Be sure to
relax during each inhalation as well, to counterbalance each long, slow exhalation.
Practise this breathing for the first half of the time you spend in Resting Pigeon, then fall
into silence for the remainder, enjoying the soothing vibration that is moving through
your body.
t a k e  c a r e
This option suits many who can’t manage other Pigeon variations due to knee issues.
Even so, ensure your bent knee feels supremely comfortable and pain-free during your
practice, and seek advice where necessary.

Sit on the front edge of a folded blanket about 5cm (2in) high to
assist the anterior tilt at the pelvis. Bend your right knee out to the
right and snuggle the sole of the foot to the left inner thigh. Place one
or more bolsters crossways over your left leg. Fold forward to rest
your arms and forehead on your bolster (or use a chair, as shown in
the Resting Wide-Leg Releases). Be sure your nose is clear, so that
you can breathe easily. Use an extra-soft block or blanket to lift the
forehead if you feel the head drops too low. Hold for two minutes on
each side. Stay present, and nudge the props away once you feel
that the body can accept more stretch.
2 .  r e s t o r a t i v e  d o u b l e - l e g  s t r e t c h .
Sit on the edge of a folded blanket, with both legs stretched out in
front. Lay a bolster lengthways along your legs, and fold forward to
rest your belly and chest on it. If your torso doesn’t touch the prop,
stack a long folded blanket on top, to a height where you are
supported. You might prefer to use a chair, as shown in the Resting
Wide-Leg Releases. Fold another blanket across your supports, so
that you can rest your forehead at a height where the neck follows
the natural line of the spine. The light pressure of the forehead
against the support becomes an important part of the restfulness of
these forward bends. Keeping the arms up higher than floor level
helps to open the front of the body, which aids effective breathing.
Stay for two to four minutes.
3 .  r e s t i n g  w i d e - l e g  r e l e a s e s .
Sit on the front edge of a folded blanket 5cm (2in) high. Bring the
soles of the feet together, so that the knees bend out wide. Bring
your heels toward your hips. Tilting forward from the pelvis, reach
your arms forward and bring them over the seat of a chair. Have the
chair far enough away that you feel a gentle stretch in the inner
thighs, back or buttocks – or all of these points. Rest your head on
the padded front edge of the chair seat. Using a yoga block can help
if you are dropping the head too far for comfort. If you don’t feel any
stretch at all, try taking the pose lower, by using bolsters and folded
blankets, as shown in the other two photos. Stay for two to four
minutes. Next, try a supported wide-legged pose, with both legs
extended out wide in a V-shape.
w h a t  t o  d o  w h i l e  y o u ’ r e  t h e r e
Enjoy soft belly-breathing. So often we hold tightness where we just don’t need to. Scan
over your body and allow all your muscles to deactivate, so that any unnecessary
holding can release. Imagine that by resting the forehead you are giving the whole frontal
lobe of your brain a rest, too.
t a k e  c a r e
Avoid these forward bends in cases of a slipped (herniated) disc or sacroiliac
dysfunction.

1 .  Take a yoga bolster, or fold a blanket to about 80 x 30 x 15cm (30
x 12 x 6in), and place it around 15cm (6in) from a wall. Sit on the
bolster, sideways to the wall, so that one hip and shoulder tip touch
the wall. Take your arms to the floor behind you and lean back.
Swivel on your buttocks as you bring your legs up the wall – if it feels
too awkward, try moving the bolster a little further away on the floor.

2 .  As your legs come up, you can rest your shoulders and head down
on the floor. Check your alignment: your sacrum should be on the
support; your lower back should drape over the bolster edge; your
tailbone (which may be close to the wall or further away if you are
less flexible) should be on the wall side of the bolster. Your chin,
chestbone, pubic bone and big toes should be in a line. Most
importantly, you should feel supremely comfortable. Stay for at least
five minutes and up to 15. To come out, bend your knees and press
your feet into the wall. Slide your bolster to the side, then lower your
hips back down and roll out to the side. After several breaths, use
your arms to push yourself up to sitting.

3 .  Consider the following options to help you relax in this pose. Take
a soft belt and tie it around your mid-thighs; this will enable your leg
muscles to fully release from the effort of subtly keeping the legs
together. Place a light covering on your eyes. To help those ever-
busy hands surrender to stillness, place a light weight like an eye-
pillow in each palm. You will continue to cool down as you rest,
particularly with your feet up high, so be sure to stay warm: cover
yourself from the feet down with a soft blanket.

w h a t  t o  d o  w h i l e  y o u ’ r e  t h e r e
Count yourself deeper into stillness. Start at 27 and track your breath, by mentally
repeating: “I am breathing in 27. I am breathing out 27. I am breathing in 26. I am
breathing out 26.” And so on, down to one. If you lose count, return to 27 and start again.
Don’t get tense about this – the aim is not necessarily to reach one. The aim is simply to
focus, slow your mind and stay present. If you reach one, then your mind will be trained
on your breath. You will be in meditation and can continue to follow the breaths with no
further need to count.
t a k e  c a r e
If you are menstruating, practise this pose without the bolster so that your upper body
rests entirely on the floor. In pregnancy, don’t practise it after 35 weeks.

n a t u r e
PARUŚA प ु  ष
PRAKRITI   क ृ   त
Yoga philosophy encompasses other Vedantic philosophies,
one of the primary ones being Samkhya . According to
Samkhya , there are two primary life forces: matter and that
which animates it. Puruśa is the aspect of our being that has a
higher unchanging consciousness. As it is pure consciousness,
puruśa is the higher Self. It is completely free of ego. It is
constant and unchanging in humans and in the universe. Being
beyond subject or object, the concept of puruśa can be tricky
to grasp, because it’s beyond the mind and it cannot be made
to be an object, as it is the very source of perception. Purśa is
pure consciousness. It is eternal, indestructible, without form
and all-pervasive.
The partner of puruśa , which impacts on everything we do,
is prakriti . Prakriti is the tangible, perceivable, material reality.
This includes things we may not be able to see, such as
infrared light or the sound waves responsible for mobile
technology. It is the aspect of everything that is subject to
cause and effect. Unlike puruśa , which is unchanging in
humans and the universe, prakriti is subject to change. You
can think of prakriti as matter and of puruśa as spirit. Pakriti
relates to your (small “s”) self-identity and is very tied up in
ego. Without the constant existence of puruśa in the
background, prakriti could not exist. Unlike puruśa , which has
an eternal quality, the defining quality of prakriti is that it is
subject to change. The consciousness of puruśa animates
prakriti , giving life to all forms of matter, such as nature,
animals and human beings.
A R E  W E  S E P A R A T E  O R  O N E ?
A fundamental cause of our suffering is that we confuse
puruśa and prakriti . On a practical basis, we assume an
identity to navigate life experience, and in the process this
causes us to forget who we truly are. This creates a feeling of
being separate from our innate interconnection with the entire
universe.
Separateness is our experience. It is valid; it is real to us
and cannot be denied. But it’s a relative separateness,
because our other reality is oneness. As we exist with two
concurrent realities, we tend to suffer as we mistake our (small
“s”) self-identity, prakriti , with our true and pure (capital “S”)
Self, puruśa . We need somehow to accept that we are both
separate and one.
When the mind is clear, we come to know our true Self. With
a highly refined mind, we experience the nature of puruśa .
The path to one leads to an understanding of the other. When
we come to know puruśa , we come to know ourselves.
Likewise, when we come to know ourselves, we come to know
puruśa .
S O  E X A C T L Y  W H O  A R E  Y O U ?
The teachings of yoga remind us that we are not our role, job
title, what we do, what we do well, our spreadsheet, our
mission statement or our values list. We are also more than
man/woman, son/daughter, worker/colleague, mother/father,
sister/brother or lover/fighter. We are pure and beyond all
these categories. We just are.
To focus on this idea and help you identify with the ultimate
reality, try repeating “So Ham ” as you sit in meditation. So
Ham means “I am that”. On each inhalation, mentally repeat,
“So ”; on each exhalation, repeat, “Ham ”.

Y I N  Y O G A
At its heart, yin yoga is a meditative practice. It’s a time when you
allow yourself to open. With plenty of time to contemplate, you’ll
cultivate mindfulness, bringing your attention to the present
experience. This witnessing of the stream of consciousness will
actively dissipate any build-up of stress. It will allow you to feel
lighter and more joyful.
The slow yin poses in this section are the perfect antidote to
the general fast pace at which we conduct our modern lives. They
are a great counterbalance to the active yang-yoga practices, and
to any other fast-moving exercise you may enjoy, and this is why
yin yoga has grown in popularity around the world over the past
few years.
While an energy-raising (active Hatha) yoga practice is useful
to help us complete our daily tasks, we do need an aspect where
we can simply let ourselves open. Transformation occurs when
you become still, quiet and open to listening. Yin uses your body
as an instrument, and the postures as your tools to transformation
and transcendence. Each yin posture comes with a precious gift
for you – the opportunity for exploration of the Self. With regular
yin practice, you are guaranteed a better understanding of the
mind–body connection, as this introspective practice links and
harmonizes your body, mind, heart and soul. Over time you will
see yourself more clearly, become familiar with any habitual
patterning of the mind and, in doing so, create some space for
simply being. (Remember: first you are a human being , before
you are a human doing .) Then you can become open and free.
Try it out – what have you got to lose?
H o w  d o e s  y i n  y o g a  w o r k ?
Yin yoga poses apply moderate and appropriate stress to the bones,
synovial capsules and other connective tissues of the body: the tendons,
ligaments and fascia. These tissues are considered to have yin qualities
– being cool, binding, slow-changing, passive and immobile – when
compared to the muscles that are considered yang. The yang nature is
warm, elastic, faster-changing, active and mobile.
The goal of yin yoga is to nourish the connective tissue, improve
circulation and flexibility in the joints, and ensure them a good supply of
synovial fluid. Each of the yin yoga postures works with one or more of
the Chinese energy meridians, or channels, and the aim of yin yoga is to
improve the flow of chi (energy), not only in the joints, but also through
these energy channels.
During yin yoga, static postures are held for around two to five
minutes each, or sometimes longer. This is distinct from the “yang”, or
active, yoga styles, which have comparatively shorter holds and feature
movement and repetition.
When we exercise muscles, they weaken, then repair and rebuild
themselves, becoming stronger. So we know that some physical stress
is actually a good thing, and that the human body can masterfully adapt
to it. Similarly, it’s not good news when a joint is not placed under
physical stress. If a joint is immobilized long term (such as in a plaster
cast), it will “freeze” and degenerate. The body welcomes and needs a
certain amount of physical stress to remain strong and flexible.
Yin tissues are best exercised in a yin way, and yang tissues in a
yang way. The mobile and elastic yang tissues, such as your muscles,
love movement and muscular engagement. However, if you were to
work your muscles in the slow yin way – say, by tensing a muscle group
for five minutes – uncomfortable contraction, cramping and soreness
would result. Nor does it always work well to exercise your yin tissues in
an overly yang way. For example, fast, strong, repetitive weightlifting can
be too aggressive for the joints and can cause injury. Think of the teeth,
which, being fairly immobile, are considered to be yin tissues. You
wouldn’t attempt to change a child’s bite with a sudden, dramatic wrench
on their teeth. Instead, orthodontists use braces to apply a constant
pressure, sustained over a long time, to realign children’s teeth. Yin
yoga operates in a similar way, using a constant pressure and the longer
holds of several minutes each. Therefore the magic of yin lies in
consistent, appropriate physical stress (not stretch), combined with time.
W h e n  c a n  I  p r a c t i s e  y i n  y o g a ?
You can practise daily, if you balance yin yoga with other active and
strengthening exercise. Keep in mind than yin yoga is not a complete
practice by itself. It targets the lower body a little more than the upper,
and it won’t make your muscles strong or your heart beat faster. Yin is a
perfect complement to active (yang) yoga practices, and to any other
active exercise you enjoy. A once-a-week complete yin practice will
nicely counterbalance a regular active yoga practice or other sporting
pursuits.
If you’d like to do a full yin practice, follow the poses in this section in
the order they are given, and finish with a Simple Restorative Twist ,
followed by any of the practices from the “Relaxations to Revel In”
section and some time in seated Mindfulness Meditation . You might
book-end your regular yoga practice with a yin pose or two, rotating
them over time, to cycle through a selection. Yin yoga is a great evening
practice for insomniacs and a helpful lead-in to relaxation and
meditation. Of course, if you are injured, do seek advice from an expert
before you practice. While props are less often used in yin yoga than in
restorative yoga, do use padding to add softness as required.
W h a t  s h o u l d  I  b e  f e e l i n g ?
The yin way of exercise is to use a slow, sustained pressure. The aim is
to protect the joints, nourish them and build mobility, while keeping them
safe as you apply a therapeutic stress though them. So while yin
postures place stress through the yin tissues of the body, it should be a
healthy and appropriate stress, within your natural range of motion for
that joint. Intuitively things should feel okay; you need to have an
emotional willingness to stay in the posture. The physical focus shifts to
the connective tissue, rather than feeling it in the muscles or tendons.
While you expect to feel a certain slow tensioning, you definitely want to
avoid uncomfortable compression. There will be no brief, jerky, bouncy
or explosive stretch.
You might choose to practise your yin postures with an intensity of
anywhere from three to eight, on a scale of ten. Most likely there will be
slowly undulating waves of intensity, with a sense of build-ups and
releases. Thoughts and impressions will come to you, so use them as a
reminder to practise mindfulness. As you stay in the postures, you will
have time for introspection and release, and can develop your
awareness of the inner silence.
t r y  t h i s  o u t
Engage your finger and palm muscles to actively stretch out the
fingers of one hand. Take one fingertip between two fingers of the
other hand and pull on it. Most likely you won’t feel any difference
in the reach or lengthening in that finger. Now soften the muscles
of the hand, and again, pull on that fingertip. When the muscles
are disengaged, you will feel a sense of “give” in the joints. There
is some lengthening, and space is being created. This is the
feeling you are aiming for in your yin poses. With your muscles
deactivated, the work can begin on the joints.

G u i d e l i n e s  t o  y o u r  y i n  p r a c t i c e
• Y o u  n e e d  t o  e n t e r  t h e  p o s t u r e s  s l o w l y  , so that the body feels safe to
release and won’t tighten up in resistance. You might need to move a
little at first, in order to settle into stillness. Then be still.
• W o r k  w i t h  s o f t  m u s c l e s  to shift the focus to working with the joints.
When the muscles are tight around a joint, the joint capsule won’t take
on the load (healthy stress), which is the aim of yin yoga. If you have
hyper-mobile joints, avoid pushing into them and learn to develop more
sensitivity at their edge.
• Y i n  y o g a  s h o u l d  n o t  b e  p a i n f u l  , although it is character-building and
you can expect to feel waves of intensity. If you are feeling pain, don’t
work so deeply into the posture and find ways to increase the support,
such as padding under the body. Speak with a yin-yoga teacher to
ensure you are on the right track. Take it easy if you have injuries, and
use props where necessary.
• T i p t o e  t o w a r d  y o u r  “ e d g e ”  , so that you come to an appropriate
edge within any natural range of motion. There is no aesthetic ideal in
yin yoga. It needs to feel safe to you. Only you are on the inside of
your experience, so only you can know that for yourself. As with active
yoga, from moment to moment, day to day and practice to practice,
your edges will be different. Be sensible and sensitive.
• S t a y  a  w h i l e .  Be still at that edge, with an attitude of surrendering into
the shape and sensations. Cultivate awareness and curiosity. Dissolve
any of your preferences. Let your awareness shine a light for you. You
might hold some poses for just one minute, so be content with that.
• A s s u m e  a  n e u t r a l  p o s i t i o n  after each pose. Lie on your back in
between yin postures, to allow the chi energy to circulate.
• A  l i t t l e  b i t  o f  c o u r a g e  i s  n e e d e d  to effect change. You need to sit at
your edge in order for the shifts to happen. If you don’t push those
boundaries, things will tend to stay the same.
• O p e n  t o  c a l m  a b i d i n g .  Long holds in the short term create discomfort,
resentment and resistance. There may be uncomfortable feelings of
being stuck – anything but being open and free. Remember that these
states of mind and body aren’t permanent. However, we tend to
perceive them as permanent, and that’s where we fall into struggle.
Remind yourself that it’s not about finding a mood, but rather about
existing in a quality of the mind that incorporates all moods.

1 .  Take a blanket and fold it up several layers thick. Sitting on the edge
of your blanket, bring the soles of the feet together in front of you and
take your knees out wide. Place your feet further away than your knees
to create a diamond shape with your legs.

2 .  Take your fingertips to the floor in front of you. Tilting from the hips,
tip forward until you feel the beginnings of a pull on your muscles. Allow
the head to hang down. Then move one more notch forward, until your
spine moves from a flat to a rounded shape and you find your first
“edge” – a holding point that is no more than six out of ten on the scale
of intensity. Three minutes is a a good length of time to for at the start,
and you can build this up to eight over repeated practices. (Setting an
alarm is helpful during yin postures.) Maintain a light supportive pressure
through the arms. Over time, you might walk your hands forward, or
even bring your elbows to the floor. If your head comes all the way to
the floor, take it inside your heels rather than beyond your toes. Take the
intensity up to seven out of ten for the last minute, or eight for a few
breaths just before your time is up.

w h a t  t o  d o  w h i l e  y o u ’ r e  t h e r e
The intensity will wax and wane as you hold each pose. While it’s your responsibility to
yourself to ensure you are not hurting your bones, joints or muscles in yoga, it is normal for
the intensity to shift, even as you hold the same pose. Observe how you respond to these
intensities, and develop a sense of detachment. Practise being the silent witness to your
experience, to neutralize reactions that make your thoughts jump around.
h o w  t o  c o m e  o u t
Press yourself upright. Use your hands to help bring your knees up, and place your feet flat
on the floor in front of you. Lean back on your hands and lift your hips in the air. Then lower
down. Repeat several times. With feet and buttocks on the floor, take both knees to one
side, then the other side, in a style similar to Reclining Eagle Twist .
m o d i f i c a t i o n s  a n d  c a u t i o n s
Take care if you have sciatica. Try raising the hips on a much higher prop, such as a firm
cushion or bolster, or avoid this pose altogether. Avoid dropping the head down if you have
had neck issues. You could try supporting the forehead on a long, high bolster to keep the
neck in its natural neutral curve. If you have any slipped (herniated) disc issues, you need to
avoid rounding the back at all. Instead, practise this pose lying down – try out the Yin Happy
Baby on or Resting Cobbler’s Poses . As with all yin postures, if you experience any harmful
sensations, such as sharp, hot or stabbing pains, come out of the pose. Before practising
this pose, read the “Guidelines to your yin practice” .

1 .  s p h i n x .
The Sphinx is your starter option, before moving on to the Seal. The
backbend shape works into the urinary-bladder and kidney meridians.
Place a folded blanket where your forearms will be. Lie on the floor
and, with your arms out in front, bend each elbow to cup it in the
opposite hand. Curve your back into a backbend, starting with your
elbows a little forward of the shoulder line. If that feels too strong for
your back, move them forward a notch or two. In yin, your holding point
is where the muscles are not switched on, so enjoy getting slouchy
through your shoulders. Remember: you want to deactivate the muscles
to take the work to the joints.

2 .  s p h i n x . 
Choose whether you would like to keep the neck in a neutral forward
position, allow the head to hang down or rest your forehead on a yoga
brick. Let your legs find their natural width apart. If it feels too strong,
put a yoga bolster under the belly to support the abdomen. Stay for up
to three to five minutes.
3 .  s e a l . 
This stronger posture has the same benefits as the Sphinx. It gives an
additional stomach stretch, plus deeper actions on the stomach and
spleen meridians.
From Sphinx, walk your hands forward and take them wider apart. Lift
your elbows to straighten your arms, which will prop you up, stilt-like.
With your elbows locked, choose your level of intensity – whether you
want to walk your hands closer to the body or further away. Disengage
your back and buttock muscles. While a small amount of compression
may stimulate energy stagnation in the lower back, ensure you don’t
overdo it: check that you are feeling tension, more than a compression,
through the spine. Allow the shoulders to sag. Stay for up to one to five
minutes. Initially you can build up to this by holding for periods of 30
seconds with short rests in between.

w h a t  t o  d o  w h i l e  y o u ’ r e  t h e r e
If the intensity is too strong for you in either pose, try activating the back muscles to do an
engaged version of the pose for short pockets of time. Then soften into the yin pose for a bit.
This way, you can move in and out of softness.
h o w  t o  c o m e  o u t
Lie flat. When you are ready, lift yourself to kneel on all fours. Exhale and take the hips back
toward the heels in Basic Child Pose . Then inhale to return to all fours. Continue moving
between these two positions for several rounds. In Child Pose again, move the hips from
side to side. Reclining Twist Flow is lovely after these backbends.
m o d i f i c a t i o n s  a n d  c a u t i o n s
Avoid during pregnancy, if you have lower-back compression, sacral discomfort or
conditions where you shouldn’t perform spinal extension. Come out, if you experience back
pain or headache. Before practising this pose, read the “Guidelines to your yin practice” .

1 .  y i n  c h i l d .
This pose works into the joints of the spine and the hips, while the
kidney and urinary-bladder meridians get a rebalance.
Kneel on a padded surface. Bring your big toes together and widen your
knees apart. Sit your hips back as close as possible toward your heels.
Walk both hands as far forward as possible, allowing your chest to drop
toward the floor. Rest your forehead on the floor. Let go of any muscle
working in this pose. As the back muscles deactivate, the work in the
joints can begin. Allow a sense of melting to come. Stay for three to five
minutes. Come out, or move on to Yin Child with a Twist.

2 .  y i n  c h i l d  w i t h  a  t w i s t .
This version has all the benefits of the Yin Child, while the shoulder-
release allows the stretch to work into the heart and lung meridians.
step 1.  From your starter Yin Child pose, walk your hands in to come up a
little. Walk both hands toward the right and position one hand on either
side of your right knee. With your hips still back and down, and both
arms outreached, thread your left arm through the window of the right
arm, ensuring it clears your right knee. Settle your left shoulder on the
floor near your right knee. Turn your head to the right and lay it to rest
on the floor. Progress on to step 2, or hold here for two to three minutes
before working into the second side.

Step 2.  Wrap your right arm around your lower back to hook your hand onto
the front of the left hip. If you can’t reach, hold onto your waistband. Let
your right arm and shoulder go heavy as the muscles release. Stay here
for two or three minutes. Then practise side two.
w h a t  t o  d o  w h i l e  y o u ’ r e  t h e r e
Imagine that any pockets of discomfort are as large as the entire space you are practising
in, so that they dilute. As they diffuse and diminish, open to the experience of ease. You can
also use conscious breathing to dissolve the intensity. Breathe into where you feel it most,
then allow each exhalation to scoop it out your body so that you become hollow. Each
exhalation can empty out those strong sensations.
h o w  t o  c o m e  o u t
Walk your hands in and push yourself up to kneeling. Take a Starter Headstand for five or
ten breaths. Then lie on your back in Corpse Pose , with your limbs stretched out wide, and
absorb the shifts in your energies as a result of this posture.
m o d i f i c a t i o n s  a n d  c a u t i o n s
Take care if you have any groin, hip or back problems, as this pose may not be for you.
Place padding under the knees or ankles, if required. If your knees don’t like this pose, try
placing a folded blanket between your seat and ankles, so that they don’t need to bend as
much. Placing a bolster under the chest makes this pose feel easier. If your hips don’t come
close to your heels, take some support – such as a yoga brick – under the forehead. All
yoga poses need to feel safe while you are in them, so come up without delay if you feel
unsafe. Before practising this pose, read over the “Guidelines to your yin practice” .

1 .  If you are new to this practice, sit your hips up on a cushion or folded
blanket. From a cross-legged position, move your knees toward each
other, until one stacks on top of the other. Usually each foot will snuggle
near an outer hip at the beginning stages. However, if your hips are
naturally more flexible, you might move each foot a little wider out and a
bit further forward. If your hips are tighter, then try the Half Shoelace:
straighten the bottom leg all the way out in front. This is also useful if
you experience pain in the bottom knee.
2 .  Whether you are in Half or Full Shoelace, tilt forward from the hips
and take your hands to the floor in front, placing them on either side of
your knees. If your spine is still straight, walk your hands forward until it
starts to round and you feel a slight pull by the outer hips or in the back.
At this starting point, allow the head to hang forward and rest. Check
that the intensity level is around six out of ten, or less if necessary.
3 .  Set your arms up for the long hold of this yin pose. You can rest your
elbows on your top leg, or it can feel nice to bend your elbows to rest
your forehead on your palms. Some people enjoy leaning in and resting
the forehead on a prop, such as a bolster standing on its end, or foam
yoga blocks. Others are able to take their elbows all the way to the floor.
If you try this, keep in mind that the aim of this yin pose is not to feel a
strong stretch in the muscles, but rather to place a controlled and
appropriate stress through the connective tissues of the body.
4 .  Start with a three-minute hold and build up to five minutes. In the last
minute you may increase the intensity to seven out of ten, then eight for
the final breaths. Follow the “how to come out” guidelines before
practising the second side.
w h a t  t o  d o  w h i l e  y o u ’ r e  t h e r e
Check that you are not striving, forcing or pushing. As you hold the poses with your muscles
deactivated as much as possible, you will experience phases of release. Your hip joints and
vertebral joints will respond to these long holds over time. Practise mindfulness – be present
to just where you are in the moment.
h o w  t o  c o m e  o u t
Come out of all yin postures slowly. Use your arms to push yourself upright. Unravel your
legs and bend them in front of you. With feet flat on the floor, lift your hips in the air a few
times to form a table-like shape. Then lie on your back, with your feet on the floor and your
knees bent, and move both legs to one side and then the other, like windscreen wipers.
m o d i f i c a t i o n s  a n d  c a u t i o n s
Avoid the Shoelace pose if you suffer from sciatica. Avoid hanging your head down if you
have had neck issues. You could try supporting the forehead on a long, high bolster to keep
the neck in its natural neutral curve. If you have any slipped (herniated) disc issues, you
need to avoid rounding the back at all – you could lie on your back, cross your bent legs at
your thighs and hug both legs in. If you have knee pain in Shoelace, you could put padding
under the top knee to lift it. As with all yin postures, if you experience pain, come out of the
pose or back off until it dissipates. Before practising this pose, read over the “Guidelines to
your yin practice” .

This strong hip-opener also decompresses the sacrum. It works on the
kidney, urinary-bladder and liver meridians.
Action.  Lie on your back. Lift your feet and bend your knees in toward your
armpits. Lift your head momentarily, as you reach your hands to the
highest point you can grasp. Hold wherever you can reach: shins, ankles
or, if possible, the insteps of the feet. If that’s not manageable, wrap
your palms or forearms around the backs of your thighs to rest them
there. Let your arms be heavy, which will help the knees drawing down.
Your lower back will round up, away from the floor. Rest your head on
the floor. Check your neck alignment. If your chin is lifted and your throat
feels like it’s gaping, try to press the chin toward the throat and lengthen
the neck. If your throat still feels very open, then place a cushion under
the head to better support the natural curve of the neck. Stay and
breathe for up to three to five minutes. Observe your breath. Just before
coming out, pull on the legs and widen the feet apart, to increase the
intensity at the hips for a few breaths.

Many people find this to be a more manageable start to Yin Happy Baby,
though when you hold it for long enough, it will still give you those yin-
yoga waves of build-up and release.
Action.  Find a friendly piece of wall and take your legs up it. Bend your knees,
to flatten your feet on the wall. Walk your feet apart so that they are a
little wider than hip width. Turn your toes out to about 45 degrees, so
that the knees also fall away from each other a little. Depending on your
flexibility, your sacrum may be lifted off the floor or flat to the floor. To
get it down to the floor, ease yourself away from the wall until it touches
down. Take your arms wide and a little way up toward the ears to access
the upper-body energy meridians. Close your eyes. Once you find an
acceptable position, resist the urge to shuffle or move. Rest here for five
minutes. Before you come out, grasp the legs or thighs and pull them in,
taking a few breaths in Yin Happy Baby.

w h a t  t o  d o  w h i l e  y o u ’ r e  t h e r e
Welcome the sensations of unfolding. Soften your inner dialogue. There’s no rush. Play and
surf your edges. Remember: time is the magic ingredient in yin practice. Once you reach a
more intense state, stay for one more minute – not with an attitude of enduring, but instead
with an attitude of opening.
h o w  t o  c o m e  o u t
Cuddle your knees into your chest. Rock from side to side. If using the wall, slide away from
it, to place both feet on the floor, with your knees bent. Lift your hips up and down several
times. Then lie flat on your back, with your limbs stretched out like a snow angel, and absorb
the physical and energetic shifts in your body.

1 .  From an all-fours position, step your right foot between your hands.
Take the foot further forward, so that the ankle joint is in front of the
knee joint. Still with your hands on the floor, inch your left knee backward
as far as possible. With your hands on either side of your front foot, this
is your starting Dragon Pose. Lift up to position your hands on your front
knee and come into a Flying High Dragon. Check that your lower back
feels good here. Remember: with all yin postures, the idea is to
strengthen the body by creating an appropriate stress in the joints, but
not to go into such intensity that there is a feeling of pain.

2 .  Try out a Flying Low Dragon and see if that’s manageable for you.
Take your hands to the floor on the left side of your right foot. Walk
them forward to lower your elbows to the floor or, if you need a little
more height, to a prop such as a folded blanket. Stay in your chosen
pose to let everything marinate. Build up to holding your chosen pose for
three to five minutes – set a timer, if you like. If you feel it predominantly
in the groin, that’s the liver and kidney meridians. If the work is more at
the front of the thigh of your back leg, the stomach and spleen
meridians are being activated. If you feel it more at the outer right thigh,
that’s the gall-bladder meridian. When your torso is lifted in the Flying
High Dragon you may feel it in the lower back, working the urinary,
bladder and, again, the kidney meridians.

Experienced Hatha yogis who love the movement and flow of active (yang-style) yoga might
find that their edge is actually stillness. Our super-busy, high-achieving world doesn’t always
understand or encourage stillness. A posture where it appears that nothing is happening
might present a bit of a challenge to a yogi who is used to the immediate satisfaction of
squeezing on strong muscles. If you notice yourself wanting to fidget, or find yourself
mentally squirming, what can I say? Be still, rest and trust. Understand that your edge may
be stillness and let the pose work its magic.
h o w  t o  c o m e  o u t
Step back to Classic Downward-Facing Dog Pose or Basic Child Pose for several breaths,
before coming onto your hands and knees to work into the second side. Reclining Eagle
Twist will soften and relax the hips after the intensity of the Dragon.

Make it more manageable by placing a support such as a bolster under the back thigh. If
your back knee or ankle is uncomfortable, place some soft padding underneath. You could

I love to breathe into the back of my heart in this pose, feeling it open
and blossom. It’s nice to shine a light on any tightness there, and allow
all those tensions to melt away.
Lie on your front and prop yourself up on your crossed forearms, with
the right arm against your chest. Slide your right forearm crossways,
thumb up. Reach it to the left, straightening the elbow as much as you
can. Then slide your left forearm away to the right. Once it’s as straight
as it will go, you will find that you can squeeze the right arm straighter,
too. Shuffle a little to get your hands one more notch away from each
other. Now “walk” your hips forward, to allow your forehead to rest on
the floor. Ensure you have come forward enough that your neck is clear,
but not so far that your nose compresses to the floor. If you can’t reach
the floor with ease, rest your forehead on a foam yoga block. Stay for
two to three minutes. Then change to the other side.

This shoulder-opener works into the lung and large-intestine meridians.
Lie on your front, with your left arm stretched straight out to the left side,
and the palm level with your shoulder. Turn your head to the right, and
place your right palm on the floor close to the right shoulder. Push into
your right palm to roll over the left shoulder. Stack your hips. Rest your
ear on the floor. Leave your left leg stretched out long, but make it easy
to balance by taking your right foot to the floor behind you, knee bent. If
you like, wrap your right forearm around your back, tucking it in under
your torso. Hold for up to three minutes. Then change to side two.

Move your awareness from the external to the internal. Go into the sensations. Experience
them as buzzing or vibrations, or as feelings of heat or cold. Sensations tend to break up
under scrutiny. Form is not permanent or solid. Don’t jump away from seemingly intractable
bands of intensity, but instead allow yourself to fall into the subtler sensations, just as you
would fall gratefully into a long-awaited and very welcome new season.
h o w  t o  c o m e  o u t
Undo the steps to slowly come out. Roll over to lie on your back, with your arms and legs
out comfortably wide. Rest a while, enjoying the sensations of release. If you want more for
the shoulders, try out Yin Child with a Twist .
m o d i f i c a t i o n s  a n d  c a u t i o n s
Seek advice before practising if you have shoulder troubles. Criss-Cross Stretch is not
suitable if you have any conditions where you shouldn’t place pressure on the abdomen.
Don’t practise these poses after ten weeks of pregnancy. Before practising, read the
“Guidelines to your yin practice” .

1 .  Fold a blanket in half and place it widthways to pad under your knees;
or use a cushion under each knee. Start on all fours. Widen out your
knees and come down onto your forearms in front of you. Spread your
knees apart, keeping them along the same line as your hips, though at
the beginning you may find it easier to have your hips slightly forward of
the knees. Take your feet away from each other, so that each ankle sits
behind the line of its knee. Flex your ankle joints, too, so that your toes
point outward. Ultimately this posture is a series of right-angles: at the
hips, knees and ankles. For extra comfort, rest your chest on a bolster
or folded blanket. Plan to stay for three to five minutes, and read on for
a further challenge or a more manageable option.

2 .  If you don’t feel you are sitting at six out of ten intensity and want to
increase the challenge, you can take one forearm across the mat, while
straightening the other arm forward. Rest your forehead on the forearm
of the bent arm. If possible, reach both arms straight out in front,
allowing your chest to touch the floor. If your neck feels healthy and up
to the challenge over this long hold, have your chin on the floor, so that
you look forward. Otherwise, place your forehead to the floor, as shown.
3 .  If you have gone beyond that first edge of six out of ten, then the
options given above are too strong for your body. Try out Half-Frog:
lengthen your left arm and leg out in one straight line, bend your right
elbow and take it out wide, level with your right shoulder. Position your
right knee out level with your hip, ankle flexed. Stay for three minutes,
before coming out to work the second side.
 
w h a t  t o  d o  w h i l e  y o u ’ r e  t h e r e
When the intensity ramps up, inhale through the nose and sigh out loudly though your mouth.
Take three breaths like this, using the exhale to clear out the build-up from your system.
Don’t let your practice become stressful. Yin yoga aims to mobilize the flow of chi , yet
stress will inhibit the flow of chi . Stay attuned to your emotional willingness to remain in the
holds.
h o w  t o  c o m e  o u t
Depending on how low you are to the ground, you will either slide forward to lie flat on the
floor or, with elbows bent to the floor, push into your forearms to lift your torso. Slowly bring
your knees closer together and take the Basic Child Pose . Next, lie on your back and cross
one thigh in front of the other, with both knees bent. Reach around to grasp your shins and
rock slowly from side to side. Change legs and rock again. Then spread out flat, with your
arms and legs wide like a snow angel, for a minute or longer, to bask in the after-effects of
your good efforts. This will allow the chi energy to circulate.
m o d i f i c a t i o n s  a n d  c a u t i o n s
Use padding under your knees to protect them. Bringing your big toes together (called
Tadpole Pose) will give much more comfort. Take more weight through the arms, as needed.
Taking the arms wider apart brings more comfort in the shoulders. Long holds in this pose
may not suit post-natal women. Before practising this pose, read the “Guidelines to your yin
practice” .

All of us, simply by virtue of being alive, act. This means that we
all have the possibility to actively participate in the spiritual
discipline of karma yoga – the yoga of action. Karma yoga is when
you perform selfless acts of service, with no attachment to the
outcome. Your actions, however simple or complex, are done with
a pure intent and your best efforts. Being detached from the
outcome of your efforts acts to purify you of the usual cravings or
aversions associated with the human experience. Caring for
children, supporting a sick friend or simply doing your job to the
best of your ability become spiritual markers if you approach them
with a meditative mindset. Your actions become uplifting
reminders that the universe is unfolding within you and through
you. So important is karma yoga that it is considered a path to
Self-realization in its own right.
Altruism is a form of karma yoga. Studies have shown it to
activate the subgenual cortex in the brain, and this is related to
social attachment and bonding, in some species. Studies of
volunteering – a form of altruism and karma yoga – show that we
stay healthier and even live longer when we volunteer. It appears
that altruism may be part of our neural wiring, in that we find it
intrinsically pleasurable to help others, and doing so promotes
social attachment and bonding. This mechanism actually seems to
work both ways – altruistic acts promote happiness, and those
who are happy are more likely to be kind.
Yoga philosophy tells us there will always be suffering around
us. When you act to help others, don’t try to fix anything. It will be
more sustainable over the long term to let go of the outcome and
simply offer your kindness.

Perhaps you have heard someone say, “If you can breathe,
you can do yoga.” This is often said as reassurance to
someone with a stiff, aged or sore body, who – for whatever
reason – is not able to attempt the more challenging postures.
But the thing is: it’s true. The breath connects us to the state
of yoga. It brings us back to the now moment, the elusive state
of existing in the present.
The breath opens us to life force. And sometimes yoga
breathing feels like an insurance policy. For those times when
you just don’t feel like rolling out your mat. For those dark days
when you feel too raw or wounded to launch into a sunny Sun
Salute. On those dark nights that you may pass in deep grief.
For those times when you can’t get off to sleep. For those
periods when you are too ill to move around much. You can,
indeed, still practise yoga at these times. You can breathe and
it can be supremely nourishing. And for the times when you
feel good, happy and relaxed, too, yoga breathing will build
your account balance of good energy for the future. What a
miracle opening to your breathing can be. At any phase and at
any time in your life, yoga breathing is relaxing, enjoyable and
meditative.

1 .  Settle yourself in any comfortable seated position. Rest one palm
on your chest and take the back of the other hand to your mid-back
area. Once your hands are in position, relax your shoulders as much
as possible.
2 .  Close your eyes. Notice how your body moves to accommodate
the breath. Let the light pressure of your hands enable you to notice
how each inhalation expands you. Then allow the natural narrowing
of the body to occur on each exhalation, and observe how both
hands subtly descend.
3 .  After one to three minutes, slide the hands down, so that one is on
your abdomen and the other on your lower back. Continue to watch
each breath. Notice the relaxed blossoming outward of the belly as
you inhale. Embrace the soft belly-breathing that comes with this full
yogic breath. Observe the movements of the back. The changes
here are subtle, so feel free to gently exaggerate your breathing, to
better clarify how the lower back moves. Imagine the breath swirling
around your lower back, dissolving any tension it meets. Stay here
for one to three minutes.
4 .  Change your arm position to wrap your palms around your side
ribs, so that each set of fingers reaches toward the other. Check that
you are cupping your ribcage rather than the waist, and that you can
then soften the shoulders. If this position doesn’t work well for you,
cross your arms in front, to give yourself a hug, and wrap your palms
around the sides of the ribcage. Notice how the breath moves into
the sides of the torso. It’s often helpful to consciously expand the
intakes of air, to let the breath open into the side body. Notice how
each inhalation will lift and broaden the ribs, while on each exhalation
they drop down and narrow. Once you have done several slow,
deeper-than-normal breaths, you may be able to return to a lighter
breath and still sense this action of the ribs. Continue to practise for
one to three minutes.
5 .  Now rest your hands on your thighs and continue to allow the torso
to open on each inhalation and to condense on each exhalation. Let
the breath feel full and wide. You may still feel the warm touch of the
palms, as a reminder of where to breathe into. Visualize a balloon in
the centre of the torso. Let it expand as you breathe in, and shrink a
little as you breathe out. Imagine it expanding fairly uniformly in all
directions – forward, backward and to each side. As you inhale, let it
also expand downward toward the pelvic floor and upward toward the
base of the throat. As you exhale, allow it to condense evenly, too.
After one to three minutes of this calm breathing, prepare to come
out slowly. Notice your degree of relaxation and how the ambience of
the mind has changed.

p o s i t i o n
Choose any comfortable seated position where your spine is effortlessly upright.
Pictured is the Happy Pose, also known as the Easy Cross-Legged Pose, where the
seat is lifted by a folded blanket. Lifting your hips above your knees will free up your
abdominal muscles to move more freely with the breath.
t a k e  c a r e
When you exaggerate the breathing to take in deeper breaths, keep it slow, rather than
speeding it up. In particular, ensure the exhalations remain manageably slow.

This breath can be used as a standalone practice, but it can also be
used throughout the entire active part of your physical yoga practice.
It can take a short while to feel really comfortable with this breath,
but it may take many months of regular practice to incorporate it fully
into your yoga poses. However, it’s so worth it. Integrating the Ocean
Breath will elevate your whole physical yoga practice and give it that
sense of moving meditation that we often long for – and then you will
understand why its Sanskrit name, ujjayi , is translated as “victorious
breath”.
1 .  The exhalation part of this Ocean Breath is the easiest part to pick
up first. Bring a small constriction to the airway at the base of the
throat, and breathe out slowly through an open mouth. As you do
this, make a sigh, like you’re fogging up a mirror. You will make a light
throaty noise, like the sound of a snoring baby. Notice how your
throat feels warm. As you relax into this part of the practice, your
exhalation may start to lengthen out. Be sure to allow your
inhalations to extend correspondingly, in order to stay balanced.
2 .  Move from the open-mouthed exhalation to the closed mouth.
Keep that same throaty breath, but place your lips together and send
the air out though the nostrils. You’ll experience the air moving
through the throat, and it almost feels as if the nostrils are bypassed.
The sound will be a little smaller, but still audible to anyone right next
to you. After a minute or so, take a rest. If you feel comfortable,
continue to the next stage. If it feels stressful, stop for now and
practice for short lengths of time over days and weeks, until it feels
easy.
3 .  Still constricting the airway, inhale. It can be helpful to imagine that
you’re breathing through a little hole at the base of the throat. Check
that the breath really does feel as if it comes from the throat, and
that it’s not a nasal sound. Although there is a constriction at the
throat, you need to feel softness and ease there. Work on getting a
constant rate of air flow on both parts of the breath – in and out. Both
inhalation and exhalation should have a sound like the distant ocean.
Enjoy the tidal flow of your breath. Practise this glottal breathing for
anywhere from a minute up to the full duration of your yoga practice,
breaking from it during your final relaxation to return to your natural
breath.

Lie down or sit in any comfortable upright position. Pictured is Perfect Pose, a wide
cross-legged posture, with one ankle on top of the other and the feet snuggled in close
to the body, to tuck in the toes. Use this throughout your Hatha yoga practice while you
hold each posture and when transitioning mindfully between poses.
t a k e  c a r e
Yoga breathwork is a personal thing and varies from person to person. If you feel
something isn’t suiting you on any level – physically, mentally or emotionally – do
consult an experienced yoga teacher. Discontinue if you feel light-headed or dizzy.

There is dedicated time for the two retentions: the nourishing fullness
of the inhalation and that delightful emptiness of the exhalation. The
pause after the inhalation allows you to get the most energy from
that intake of air. Both pauses deepen your concentration, as does
the mental counting. Counting takes the mind away from those
mundane everyday thoughts and moves it into that elusive present-
moment awareness, which elevates us and makes us feel happy. I
hope you fall in love with this exercise, too.
1 .  Sit comfortably tall or, better still, lie down. Begin with a clean
slate, by letting the air flow out of your lungs. Now inhale while you
take a slow count of four. Maintain a steady rate of air flow through
the nostrils. Rather than starting with a stronger or faster initial
inhalation, which ends with a strangled flow, this is more controlled.
Meter the timing, so that this constant air flow fills the lungs to
comfortably brimming, just as you reach the number four.
2 .  Now invite the breath to linger, as you would invite a much-loved
guest to linger in your home. Hold the breath in for two counts. Enjoy
the way your ribcage has opened to allow you to hold this full breath.
Check that your facial muscles and tissues are soft. Release any
unnecessary hardness or holding in your body.
3 .  Exhale during a count of four. As with the inhalation part of the
breath, aim to maintain a constant rate of air flow from the nostrils,
timing it so that you are empty as you reach four.
4 .  Hold your breath out for two beats. Sink into the soothing quiet
that comes with this emptiness. Like floating effortlessly on top of a
still pond, it’s a chance to really touch that nugget of stillness that
resides within us always, but which can easily be lost in a busy
modern life.
5 .  You have now completed one round. Start your next four-beat
inhalation and continue on for another five to 15 rounds. Then relax
all efforts and rest while you absorb the benefits of the practice.
e f f e c t s
Revitalizing, expanding, energy-enhancing, focusing, quietening
p o s i t i o n
Sit comfortably or lie down. What’s great about lying down is that all those muscles that
usually hold you up don’t need to work as hard, because the body is fully supported by
the earth. So any muscles that have dual breathing and postural roles can now dedicate
themselves to their task of supporting a full, deep breath.
t a k e  c a r e
Don’t hold the breath in if you have high blood pressure. Avoid holding the breath in or
out during pregnancy.
m o d i f i c a t i o n
If the 4:2:4:2 ratio of inhale: pause: exhale: pause feels manageable, step it up by
lengthening the active parts of the breath. Breathe in and out for a count of five, while
maintaining the two-beat pauses. If this 5:2:5:2 ratio works well for you, increase it again
to 6:3:6:3, so that you are breathing in and out for six counts, and holding the breath for
three.

1 .  Sit comfortably with your eyes closed and notice the rate and
depth of your respiration. Breathing through your nose, spend some
time noticing how long your inhalations are. Then move your mind to
your exhalations and observe how long they are.
 
2 .  Continue to inhale through your nostrils, but move the exhalation
to your mouth. Let your lips be wide and soft, and allow the air to flow
out soundlessly. If it feels comfortable and effortless, narrow the
distance between the lips – perhaps bringing them so close together
as to imagine holding a paper tissue between them. This narrow
aperture should create no tension around your soft lips. It should
assist the exhalation in lengthening out a little, so do ensure that you
keep a nicely balanced breath. Continue to take leisurely inhalations
though both nostrils.
 
3 .  Each time you exhale, feel the touch of the air leaving the body
and visualize it as a fine golden thread of air extending out in front of
you. As the exhalations are slow and unhurried, your slender golden
thread may undulate softly. As the exhalations are long, so the thread
extends out, perhaps surprisingly far.
 
4 .  At the end of this golden thread, place any worries or concerns
that you have. I like to imagine a neat little cane basket floating out in
front, ready to accept anything I want to put in it. Without speeding
up the breathing at all, continue to watch this basket. The beautiful
thing about observing these concerns is that they are now
externalized. Being out in front, they are no longer a part of you. You
can experience yourself freely, without these troubles.
 
5 .  To close, decide where you would like to place the issues at the
end of your golden thread. It’s up to your imagination, so it can be
anywhere at all. And it’s also up to you whether or not you choose to
take any of them back. Then return to your easy breathing, in and
out through the nose, to calmly watch the breath for several minutes.
e f f e c t s
Calming, soothing, healing
p o s i t i o n
It’s best to be upright for this practice. Kneeling postures, cross-legged options or
seated on a chair are all suitable. If you are cross-legged on the floor, it’s helpful to have
some support under your seat. Anatomically, when the hips are lifted in comparison to
the knees, it will be easier to draw yourself up tall, to maintain the full dignity of your
posture.
t a k e  c a r e
Do seek advice from a professional if you need further help.
m o d i f i c a t i o n
If practising with the eyes closed takes you to dark places that you don’t want to visit,
then open your eyes.

1 .  Sit in a comfortable upright position. Place a hand on each thigh,
palm up and the tips of your thumbs and index fingers touching. Take
your right arm out to the side and, as you inhale, sweep it in a wide
arc to bring it overhead. Do this over a count of five beats. The wide
arm sweeps encourage slightly longer inhalations, which means that
the exhalations will also tend to elongate and the whole system can
settle.

2 .  Once the arm is overhead, hold your breath in for a count of three
while you bend your right elbow to lower your arm. Use your right
thumb to cover your right nostril. With your right nostril now closed,
exhale out of your left nostril for a count of eight beats. Once your
lungs have emptied, hold the breath out for three counts while you
lower your right hand to rest on your thigh again.

3 .  Now change the arms so that you raise your left arm for five
beats. Hold in your breath for three, as you lower your arm and cover
your left nostril. Breathe out through your right nostril for a count of
eight. Hold the empty breath for three, as you lower your left hand to
rest on the thigh. This is one complete round. Continue, alternating
right and left arms, for five to ten more rounds, finishing with the
exhale through the right nostril. Then sit quietly and absorb the way
the textures of the mind have changed.

Choose your most comfortable position. Pictured is a wide-kneed Hero Pose, but any

supported kneeling option, or cross-legged with your seat on a cushion. If using a chair,
resist leaning into the chair back, but sit tall using your own muscle power.
t a k e  c a r e
It’s completely normal to have one nostril slightly more open than the other. If one nostril
feels blocked to the point of discomfort, try only partially covering the other nostril, so
that the restricted side can still maximize the flow of air as much as is doable.

Feel free to count off the beats slower or faster, if you wish to. Ensure the 5:3:8:3 ratio
works for you. Talk to an experienced yoga teacher if you think you’d prefer a different
ratio – there are lots of other options.

Yoga Sutras II:15
This sutra speaks of the causes of suffering, and the first
cause on the list is change, parinama . All matter is subject to
change. As no matter is constant, change is inevitable, yet it
disturbs us. The suffering around change can come from four
sources:
• Suffering is created when things change around you that
impact on what you feel in a negative way. For example, you
lose your job or something special to you.
• We also suffer from what we don’t have, but want. There are
cravings both small and large. Not getting that promotion, not
finding your “one true love”, a delay in receiving your morning
coffee, any time you find yourself wishing for more of an
experience that you found pleasurable in the past.
• A third cause of suffering is conditioning from the past,
samskaras . This is when you repeat patterns or behaviour,
consciously or unconsciously, which don’t serve you or are
even harmful.
• Finally, changes within yourself – at least undesirable
changes – will also cause suffering.

THE THREE GUNAS:
RAJAS
The energy of creation, motion, passion, action and
preservation.
TAMAS
The energy of destruction, inertia, heaviness and disorder.
SATTVA
Peace, harmony, wholesomeness, lucidity and balance
A key concept in Indian philosophy is that of the gunas . The
word guna means “string” or “strand”, and these threads
weave together to form all of creation, past and present. There
are three gunas , and they are important to understand
because the origin of change is simply the fluctuation of these
gunas .
The three gunas are rajas , tapas and sattva . Rajas is the
energy of creation, motion, passion, action and preservation.
Tamas , its opposite, is the energy of destruction, inertia,
heaviness and disorder. Sattva contains the qualities of peace,
harmony, wholesomeness, lucidity and balance. Each of these
gunas is present in us and in every single thing around us.
They don’t act like a simple “on” or “off” switch. Instead, while
the gunas are always present, they fluctuate in relative
dominance. These fluctuations are what create change and the
rate of change. Their state of flux may be fast or incredibly
slow. Your bad mood can change the instant you receive terrific
news. Conversely, while the enormous oceans appear to
remain constant, science tells us they are changing, too.
The presence of the gunas can be observed acting on us all
the time: they give the various flavours to the different times of
day as we switch between work, rest and play. The effects of
the gunas can be seen in the seasons, the food we eat and the
lifestyle we choose. The gunas act on our thoughts, our
desires, our moods and our personalities.
H O W  C A N  I  D E A L  W I T H  C H A N G E ?
We understand that all matter (including our own matter),
being subject to the gunas , will change. It’s inevitable. We also
understand from the yoga teachings that no one can avoid
suffering. Even the most enlightened yogis will experience the
effects of change, simply because they still have a body.
Knowing that change is affected by the relative dominance
and balance of the differing qualities of the gunas is actually
very empowering, as we can consciously choose to take action
to redress any imbalance. We can decrease or increase any of
the qualities, usually by doing something in the opposite
direction. Often the simplest of things will balance you out. For
instance, you can counter feeling tired and heavy by a light and
energetic activity, such as dancing or a flowing yoga practice.
On the other hand, if you need to sleep but find your mind is
still on active alert, ensuring that your room is dark, eliminating
screen-time and drinking a liquid such as milk, which has a
heavy energy, will support the quality of inertia that is required
for sleep.
Change is a problem for us when our thoughts and feelings
are habitual, rather than adaptive, and have trouble shifting to
accept the change. It can take time for our nervous system to
assimilate change. And if our chronic stress response is
reinforced during this process, it can feel really hard even to
access our capacity for change. The stress created by change
can lead to anxiety ordepression. When we can choose to
respond to our experience, rather than react, we create the
optimal conditions to assimilate change.
Awareness can support us in recognizing any resistance to
change that we may be experiencing and examine it more
closely. Rather than pushing away or collapsing in the face of
change, we can become curious about what exactly is
happening at a deeper level, and hold ourselves with great
kindness as we potentially explore new ways of being.
It may sound bleak, but it’s not. Change is also an
empowering tool – you can change your mind at any time.
Understanding how inevitable change is can shift you from
victim mode (poor me, why me?), because the reality is
actually “why not me?” It can help you to move on from
unhelpful emotions like blame, guilt and regret. It’s possible to
influence change in a positive direction. The experience of
suffering will provide the energy to search for a solution.
Understanding that we are all subject to suffering, and that
someone else’s pain could be your own, allows you to cultivate
compassion. We know there is no hierarchy of suffering. No
one person’s difficulties are any less legitimate than another’s.
Keep in mind that even the same painful event will be
experienced with different intensities by different individuals.
Practise the Loving-Kindness Meditation and the Gratitude
Meditation .
Awareness and self-enquiry are stepping stones to dealing
with suffering. Yoga practices, and particularly meditation, can
help in clarifying your perception and keeping you connected to
that serene, greater Self (practise the Mindfulness Meditation
). This will mean that you can meet those inevitable shifts,
heartbreaks, yearnings or painful patterns with equanimity and
then move forward with grace.

For many people, their smartphone is the first thing they touch
in the morning and the last thing they check at night. Busyness
has crowded out spaciousness. Spaciousness is the opposite
of stress and a key factor in relieving it. Where stress makes
you feel contracted and tight, spaciousness is loose and
expansive. The bottom line is: spaciousness feels goooood .
Yoga postures enable the body to feel spacious inside. They
help counter stress simply through the mind–body connection.
That feels good. But what feels even better is to close every
practice that you do with a relaxation, like the ones that follow.
Stay resting in one of these reclining postures as long as
you can. It takes about 15 minutes for the physical body to
relax. Your bones will feel heavy and your muscles can
release. Your mind will start to slow, and you’ll drift through
various stages of release. While you may still notice your
thoughts, there will be less identification with them. You can
sometimes drop into an even deeper state, where you are
awake and yet disconnected from the outer world. It’s a special
space you don’t know you have entered until you come back
from it. And, like your thoughts, any noises just wash over you,
leaving you undisturbed.
I’ll tell you a secret. Even if you have had no time, been too
tired, or for any other reason have not done a single yoga
posture, you can still do a beautiful life-enhancing relaxation. If
you need to justify why you are taking 20 minutes’ time-out, tell
yourself that the more switched on you have become, the
more time-efficiently you need to learn to switch off. And, with
practice, you will become more efficient at relaxation.
But I hope you don’t feel the need to justify taking this time,
because you deserve to recharge. You deserve to feel the
world drop away as you detach from your thoughts. You
deserve to experience the delightful qualities of spaciousness
and emptiness. Because it feels good. And to feel good is your
birthright.

Lie on your back with a folded blanket under your head. Create a
small roll to support the curve of the neck. Check that your forehead
is slightly higher than your chin. Make any fine adjustments to ensure
that you feel comfortable enough to commit to stillness. Just as when
you throw a pebble into a still pond it disturbs the water, so any
movements made while in deep relaxation will send ripples of
disturbance though your system. If you are pregnant, use a bolster
lengthways under your spine, or lie on your left side and place one
pillow under your head and another between your thighs.

1 .  Choose your favourite resting position. Have your arms out to the
sides, with palms facing up. Take time to check your level of comfort
and cushioning and to release any last fidgets. Take your awareness
to your hands. With the palms soft and fingers gently curled in
relaxation, imagine you are breathing in and out of your palms. Each
time you inhale, imagine both palms absorbing the air; and each time
you exhale, experience your breath flowing out of the palms. Stay
with this for a minute or two. You may observe that this simple act of
watching your breath will help it to slow down, which enhances the
relaxation effect.
 
2 .  Do the same with your feet. With each inhalation, sense your
breath moving into your body through the soles of your feet. Then,
without any hurry at all, allow the air to exit through the feet as well.
Experience your feet becoming open and transparent as you enjoy
the process over the next one to two minutes.
 
3 .  Next, move your awareness to your abdomen. Again, as if you
didn’t need your lungs to breathe, visualize the air moving in through
your navel, and exhale out from your navel centre. Notice how your
belly moves in response to each of the stages of your breath. Stay
with this for a minute or two.
 
4 .  Now move your focus to your heart centre in the middle of your
chest. Inhale, directing your breath in through this space, and
experience yourself exhaling directly through it, too. Repeat this for
one minute. Then start to inhale calm through your heart centre.
Allow your heart to fill up with this calm, and each time you exhale, let
it diffuse out through your whole body. Enjoy the process of collecting
it as you inhale, and then leisurely letting it go, to filter out in all
directions – through your torso, along your limbs to the tips of your
fingers and toes, and releasing gently into the head.
 
5 .  After a minute or two, change your focus word. Inhale kindness
into your heart. Enjoy your naturally lengthened exhalations and,
each time you breathe in, simply inhale kindness. Enjoy the release
that naturally occurs each time you breathe out, and start to spread
that through the body. Enjoy receiving the energy that comes with
each inhalation of kindness, then letting it go as it spreads over the
shoulders and down the arms to the hands. Let it spread over the
hips on its way down the legs to the toes. Let kindness diffuse up into
the head. Stay with this for two minutes, or as long as you wish, then
let go of all efforts and float for a while. Come out slowly with a soft
smile.

Lie on your back, with your hands beside your hips and your feet
comfortably wide. Try taking your arms a little wider than they might
be initially and allow the shoulders to soften. Likewise, take your feet
one notch wider than you might already have them, and sense
whether that could enable you to relax more easily. The body often
likes a little weight on it, so try placing a light weight such as an eye-
pillow on each palm, with your thumbs draped on top. Place another
eye-pillow over the heart centre. Cover the eyes with a fourth eye-
pillow. If you are pregnant, use a bolster lengthways under your
spine, or lie on your left side and place one pillow under your head
and another between your thighs.
 
1 .  Choose your preferred relaxation position. Take your focus to the
exhalation part of each breath. Each time you breathe out, exhale
down from the crown of the head, through the throat to the heart
centre in the middle of the chest. Stay with this for a minute or more.
Your only task is to track that exhalation downward. Appreciate the
sense of happy unravelling as you let go with each exhalation. Each
exhale takes you closer to stillness and silence. Enjoy that.
 
2 .  Next, add the inhalations to your awareness. Direct each inhalation
upward, so that each one starts at the navel and travels up to the
heart centre. You now have a focal point for each part of the breath.
On each full yogic breath, you will inhale and follow the breath up
from the navel to the heart. On each exhalation, you’ll drop your
awareness from the crown of the head down to the heart. Continue
this process for two or three minutes.
 
3 .  While you are running the energies up and down your body, you
are helping to balance out the dualities within. The opposite forces of
heaviness and lightness come better into balance. Areas of
deficiency and excess can even out. You will feel expansive and yet
grounded, playful and yet determined, and will balance silence with
action. Masculine and feminine, and any other opposite qualities
residing within you, will become less distant. You’ll be able to
experience how being in balance is so much more comfortable than
being out of balance.
 
4 .  Give a colour to each of part of the breath. Perhaps black for the
rising breath, and white for the falling breath. Over the next few
breaths, visualize these two colours meeting at the heart. Allow them
to twirl into a flowing spiral. Breathe into this spiral of colour, allowing
it to swell, then as you exhale let the colours diffuse through the
whole body. Continue this for another minute or, if you have time,
longer. Then just stay resting for a while. When you are ready to
come out, sense your physical body. Make tiny movements with your
fingers and toes. Expand those movements to your ankles and
wrists. Move and stretch in any way that feels good. Open the eyes
and return slowly and gracefully to your outer world.

Shown here is the Corpse Pose, Savasana , with the natural curve of
the neck supported by a roll created from a folded blanket. Check the
height of your blanket roll, so that your forehead is slightly higher
than your chin. In addition to the neck roll, tuck the blanket under at
the side corners, to cradle the sides of your head as a winged
aeroplane seat does. When your head is completely supported in this
symmetrical position, your neck muscles will no longer need to work
subtly, to hold your head steady, and you will relax more easily. If you
are pregnant, use a bolster lengthways under your spine, or lie on
your left side and place one pillow under your head and another
between your thighs.
 
1 .  Choose your most comfortable relaxation position, taking time to
fine-tune any props and positioning yourself so that you don’t cheat
yourself out of feeling supremely comfortable. With your eyes closed,
check in with your breath. As you breathe in, simply think of your
head. Then, when you breathe out, think of your chest. For the next
ten or so breaths, continue moving between these two areas of
focus: head to chest. This is the beginning of the process of getting
excess energy out of the head, by drawing it lower down in the body.
 
2 .  Next, each time you inhale, take the breath into your chest. When
you exhale, think of your lower-back area. Allow yourself to breathe
out of your lower back, letting it soften and lengthen. Notice the
completely unforced, natural expansion of your upper torso as you
take each breath in through the front of the chest. When you breathe
out through the lower back and kidney area, allow any lower-back
tensions to dissipate. Let any hardness in the lower back dissolve.
Continue this chest/lower-back focus for ten breaths or longer.
 
3 .  Finally, lower your focus to move it between your lower back and
your feet. Take your inhalations into your lower back. Enjoy the
expansion in your lower back as it absorbs your breath. Breathe out
though the soles of your feet. Let your lower back and kidneys soak
up the breath in an unhurried way, and drop your energy down to
your feet as they let go of each exhalation. Continue this practice for
ten breaths or longer. Then notice any differences in the textures of
your mind compared to when you started.

If you have six or seven blankets, try out this position. To form a
support for the backs of the knees, use either a yoga bolster or two
blankets, folded three times and then rolled up together, Roll up a
single blanket to place under your Achilles – the ankle arch just
above your heel bone. It should be half the height of the knee roll.
Fold another blanket to make a pillow for your head. Test out the
height – when you lie back, your forehead should be level with, or
slightly higher than, your chin. Use one more blanket to lift each
forearm slightly. Ensure that you will be warm, so cover yourself with
another blanket if necessary. If you are pregnant, use a bolster
lengthways under your spine, or lie on your left side and place one
pillow under your head and another between your thighs.
1 .  Choose your most comfortable lying position. Scan over your body
to check that you feel luxuriously comfortable. If anything needs
adjusting, take the time to do so. Sometimes the mind can latch onto
the smallest of discomforts or asymmetries, and this will impede your
journey into deep relaxation.
 
2 .  Notice the expansive qualities of every inhalation. Observe how
each one gently fills your belly and chest. In classic relaxed yogic
breathing, the belly will move first, followed by the chest, as the air is
drawn into the lungs. But don’t try too hard. Simply allow whatever is
there to be there. Each inhalation will subtly lift you. Open yourself to
a sense of floating every time you breathe in.
 
3 .  After a few minutes, begin to notice the releasing qualities of each
exhalation. Allow each exhalation to float you down, as if you get a
little heavier as you breathe out. This sinking effect can feel like
coming home. Come home to your true essential nature. Peaceful
you. Pure you. Calm you. Content you. Joyful you. Blissful you. Let
all the other noise of life drop away as you continue to follow your
breath, floating with each inhalation and sinking with each exhalation.
Stay like this for another few minutes.
 
4 .  Now start to count your breathing backward from 33 down to one.
Mentally repeat your yourself: “I am breathing in 33, I am breathing
out 33; I am breathing in 32, I am breathing out 32,” and so on down
to one. If you lose track, return to 33 and start again. The purpose is
not necessarily to reach one, but simply to count yourself into a
deeply restful space. If you reach one, release all efforts. Just float.
 
5 .  When it’s time to come back, feel the touch of the floor and
supports underneath you, as if you have just floated on warm tropical
waters and arrived at the sandy shore. Let the sandy bed come up
underneath your body. Experience how good it feels in your physical
body to be this relaxed. Check in with the atmosphere of your mental
body. Notice the textures of your emotional body. If you believe in a
fourth dimension, check in with your soul body, too. With all these
dimensions harmoniously wrapped up in your physical body, you will
be ready to resume your day, revitalized and alive.

SAMSKARAS स ं  क ा र
A samskara is a psychological imprint that causes us to repeat
patterns of behaviour. Yoga philosophy teaches us that every
action we take and every intention we have will create an
impression, a samskara . Samskaras show up in our
tendencies and habits, and become part of our character
structure.
Each samskara was originally of value in our lives and
provides us with pleasure or allows us to avoid suffering.
However, any samskara – even that which originally created
pleasure – has the potential to create suffering, as the purpose
it serves in our lives changes as our lives alter. Suffering will be
created if we don’t change the patterns in our lives to respond
to our life changes. Suffering is created when our lived
experience of the present doesn’t match our previous
experience (or our projected idea of what our current
experience “should” be). In other words, suffering is caused by
our inability to accept that everything – including ourselves – is
subject to change, and that change is constant.
Samskaras rule our lives in ways we don’t even notice.
These habits and unconscious patterns cause us to react in
ways that may no longer be helpful. Rather than consciously
responding to life as it currently is, the first step in dealing with
samskaras is awareness, so that we can know exactly who is
driving the bus we are on. Under the yoga precept of self-study
– svadhyaya – you can develop the self-awareness to
determine what it is about your behaviour that you want to
change, and can analyse what is holding this behaviour in
place. It can be helpful to consider the gunas here. If tamas is
dominant, it is likely to manifest in feelings of heaviness,
inertia, laziness, procrastination and feeling “stuck”. A
predominance of rajas may feel rewarding initially, as you can
get lots done, but you may be over-stimulated by the continual
On-switch into the passion, action and excitement this guna
generates. A shortage of sattva shows up as not having the
clarity of mind to clearly perceive the situation that you are
facing and to plan the steps or tasks ahead.
H O W  T O  E R A D I C A T E  T H E  S A M S K A R A S
Consider the results of your samskaras . What are you getting
out of the situation as it is? If you can reduce the attachment
to the result, you will weaken the samskara . Each thought and
action is a seed that will grow. It’s important to cut the negative
thought-seeds before they get to the threshold of creating a
strong samskara , which is harder to root out. The more often
you indulge a habitual pattern, the more you strengthen the
neural pathways in the brain responsible for giving you a sense
of satisfaction, pleasure or pain, and the harder it is to change.
This is great when you are a classical musician and you
practise diligently to perform at your best. But it’s not so great
if you practise indulging in sensual pleasures, such as over-
eating, when you really would like to lose weight.
So root out samskaras early, and be diligent when you
notice the patterns sneaking back in. Practising yoga on a
regular basis gives you a constant reference point, so that you
can keep track of your experience and continually refresh your
internal “browser” and keep it up to date. Your yoga practice
can support you to notice at a deeper level any habitual
tendencies that are not in alignment with your chosen goals or
values. Awareness is the key to change. Practising new
behaviours in the direction that you consciously choose to
follow will strengthen new neural pathways, and over time it will
weaken any unconscious pathways that were the basis of
known and familiar previous patterns of thought and behaviour.
Eradicate any “stinking thinking” – those thought patterns
that can send you into a downward spiral. When you catch it
occurring, tell yourself to stop it: remember that you are a
powerful being. Becoming aware takes practice. Once you
have spent some time creating a clearer mind, your thought
patterns will become more obvious to you, and you will become
better at discriminating between thoughts that are beneficial to
your well-being and thought-patterns that may lead to less
optimal states of being.
Think about what you are planting with your thoughts,
intents and feelings. What is it that you really want to grow?
Replace unhelpful thoughts with a more appropriate and true
thought-stream, which will create new neural pathways.
Remember: with neuroplasticity, we know that neurons that fire
together, wire together. If you starve the seed to weaken that
samskara while you create and strengthen the positive, you
are on your way. And do consult a professional if you need
help analysing the causes or dealing with the effects of your
samskaras .

Some people think meditation is a particular mood, like a goal to
be reached. But meditation is not a mood. It’s a quality of mind
that can incorporate all moods. Other people despair of their busy
minds, declaring, “I can’t meditate.” The thing is: it is the very
nature of your mind to be busy and create thoughts. But you don’t
need to stop the thinking to benefit from meditation practice.
Instead, create equanimity by disassociating yourself from
distracting or disturbing thoughts. In this way, by changing your
relationship with your thoughts, you can come out of suffering.
When we are able to let go of any frustrations, discomforts or
sleepiness we meet on the path, we open to the calm, abiding
effect of meditation. And then we find that meditation helps us to
become more grounded and resilient, less reactive to triggers,
and simply more content.

We live in a fast and furiously efficient world. Technology has
given us some freedoms, but it has bound us in other ways. It’s
now so easy to be constantly available for your job and to fall into
work overload. Even our quiet time might involve staring at a
screen, with a weekend spent binge-watching, Web-surfing or
pinging and liking on social media. So it’s more important than
ever to disconnect from the sea of technology and connect back
to ourselves. It’s time to move on from wired-and-tired, and step
up to be inspired.
We wear “busy” like a badge of honour. There is even a term
for it: “Western laziness and Eastern laziness”. Eastern laziness
means not fully stepping up to life. After all, with the possibility of
another incarnation, you could be tempted to take it easy, to the
detriment of not realizing your full potential in this life. Western
laziness, on the other hand, means not having the discipline or the
ability to say no. There is so much encouragement to do more
that we race around, as modern life seduces us outside
ourselves.
W h a t  h a p p e n s  t o  u s  w h e n  w e  a r e  s t r e s s e d ?
Stress means that many people are tuned in and switched on all
the time, and have unlearned how to tune out and centre down.
Stress seems to be the new norm. It’s what we expect to feel.
Under stress, our adrenaline-based nervous system kicks in.
When we are under stress, we go on hyper-alert. It doesn’t even
matter whether or not the stress is real. Even the perception of
stress will switch on our “fight or flight” mechanism.
With the release of stress hormones, blood supply is diverted
away from the “not essential in an emergency” organs of the
digestive and reproductive systems and is sent to the “this is an
emergency, I might have to run away from the lion” parts of the
body. Is it any wonder that so many people suffer from digestive
problems and have trouble with infertility? Glucose levels rise,
increasing the risk of diabetes; we find ourselves too wired to fall
asleep, or wake up in the early hours and can’t get back to sleep.
Under stress, the blood vessels constrict and the heart beats
faster, increasing the risk of high blood pressure, heart disease or
a stroke. The immune system is suppressed, making us more
susceptible to disease. We suffer from fatigue and exhaustion.
W h a t ’ s  t h e  g o o d  n e w s ?
Regular meditation or mindfulness practice has consistently been
shown to reduce stress and stress-related illness. It switches off
the “fight or flight” response, can lower blood pressure, supports
the immune system and reduces stress-related illness, such as
heart disease, depression and anxiety. Sleep quality, cognitive
abilities, coping skills and interpersonal relationships are
enhanced. The faster you live and the more stressful your life, the
more important it is to find efficient mechanisms to decompress –
and meditation might be exactly the antidote you need.

Shown is Lotus Pose, Padmasana , which is harder than it looks, so do
warm up first. Try Perfect Pose if this is not comfortable for you. To fold
in the right leg, bend your knee and allow the thigh to fall out to the right.
Take hold of the foot and slide it on top of the left thigh, bringing the heel
as close to the left hip as possible. Externally rotate your left thigh,
allowing the knee and toes to fall to the left. Bend the knee to hold your
foot and squeeze your right knee towards the floor. Carefully slide the
left ankle on top of the right to bring the heel towards the hip. Place your
hands in Jnana mudra , with thethumb and the index finger forming a
circle.
1 .  R e l a x . Choose a comfortable upright position, such as Perfect Pose .
 
2 .  B r e a t h e . Observe the rate and depth of your respiration. When
observing the sensations of the breath, find the most obvious places for
you. It might be movements of the chest or the belly. It could be the air
moving through the nostrils, or the touch of the air on the skin of the
upper lip. Use your chosen point to help draw in your focus. Each time
you breathe in, you simply know that you are breathing in. Each time
you breathe out, you just know you are breathing out.
 
3 .  W a t c h . Observe your stream of thoughts from the point of view of a
passive witness. It’s a bit like sitting by a highway and watching the cars
pass. Obviously you are not the cars (your thoughts that arise are); you
are a silent observer of the stream of thoughts. What may happen as
you sit by the highway is that you find you have boarded the bus of your
thoughts and it’s taken you off on a trip somewhere else. Meditation is
simply about beginning again. Wake up to the awareness that you have
lost your witnessing self by jumping on that bus, and hop off it. So much
of meditation practice is really about remembering to come back. And as
it will happen over and over again, smile kindly on yourself and simply
begin again. Remember: any upset will only send ripples of disturbance
through your system, which is counterproductive.
 
4 .  A l l o w . Let your experience be what it is. Mindfulness is a non-dual
practice. No one thing is considered more special than another. Nothing
is omitted from mindfulness practice. Everything in your field of
awareness is cherished, just because it’s in your field. There is no
pushing away the “bad” or craving the “good”. Continue to observe your
thoughts with a gentle curiosity. Awareness is non-invasive. Awareness
doesn’t alter what we are noticing, so there are no biases. It is also
illuminative. It shines a light on what is, right now. These pockets of right
now are perfect moments. It’s not about never being disturbed again,
but about ordinary moments lived in extraordinary ways.

Choose a simple upright posture in which you won’t stiffen or tense up.
A simple cross-legged pose, also called Happy Pose, is pictured here.
Using a cushion for support lifts your hips higher than your knees. This
means that your back and abdominal muscles won’t need to work so
hard for you to remain sitting erect with ease and you will be able to
relax better into the posture.
1 .  Choose your most comfortable upright position. Close your eyes and
settle in. Use relaxed belly-breathing. Notice how when you inhale, your
abdomen expands first, followed by your chest as the air is drawn into
your lungs. But don’t try too hard; simply allow what is there to be there.
 
2 .  When you give your busy mind this little job to do, you will zone into
the present moment and stress tends to fall away. Inhale and apply a
mental count of one to that inhalation. Exhale and again count one.
Inhale and mentally count two. Exhale and think two. Inhale and
mentally say three. Exhale three. Inhale four. Exhale four. On your next
inhalation, return to one, so that your next sequence repeats in exactly
the same way: One and one. Two and two. Three and three. Four and
four. Then return to one again.
 
3 .  Continue for eight full rounds. Then cease the counting, but continue
resting your full attention on the simple act of breathing in and out. Most
likely your mind will be quieter, as you have now trained it just to sit on
the breath, as lightly as a butterfly will sit on a flower. You are now
meditating on your breath. Stay as long as you wish: ten or 20 minutes
is good (set a timer beforehand, if you wish). If you have time, it’s good
to resist that first and second urge to move out of this practice. Take the
urge to move as an invitation to go deeper.

From a high kneeling position, separate your feet and then sit down
between them, in a seated Hero Pose. Use a prop such as a folded
blanket or yoga block under the buttocks, if you wish. Rest your hands
on your thighs.
1 .  Sit and centre yourself. Imagine that you have just tasted your
favourite food. There’s an appreciative sound that goes with that. Let the
sound of mmmmmmm arise spontaneously. Over your next few breaths,
inhale quietly, then exhale; as you exhale, make the nice, slow
mmmmmmm sound aloud. Over the following breaths, let the sound
quieten a little. Even when it is barely audible, observe how it still
resonates through your body.
 
2 .  Now bring to mind the simple things that you have and love. It might
be the nature around you, a sunny day or a good laugh.
 
3 .  Consider the special people in your life. Consider those who care for
you, and those who cared for you in the past. Bring to mind the previous
generations who came before you. Trusted friends. Your community.
 
4 .  Consider the health, well-being and safe harbour you have been
given. Bring to mind with gratitude the teachings you have received. Just
let your stream of consciousness flow. What you focus your mind on will
naturally tend to expand. How positive it is to bring to mind all these
wonderful blessings.
 
5 .  Let go of sounding your sounds of gratitude. Stay sitting and let the
vibrations of the sound continue to resonate. Once the vibrations
dissipate, let your breath be your focal point. Observe any effects of
doing this practice. Then open your eyes.

You don’t have to fold your legs up, pretzel-like, to meditate. Any upright
seated position can work well. Sit in a chair; ensure that your feet touch
the floor easily and place them on a higher support if they don’t. To help
take the stress out of your shoulders, fold a blanket several layers thick
and place it on the tops of your thighs. Place your hands on the blanket,
palms up or down. The aim is to have your elbows positioned exactly
under your shoulder joints and bent at 90 degrees, so make the blanket
higher if necessary.
There are many variations of this Loving-Kindness Meditation, and I
believe each is of great value in our modern world. I have included a
version that uses the breath as a really nice anchor. A good intention to
start off with is to vow to open to this practice, for the benefit of all
beings.
1 .  Sit comfortably upright. Close your eyes. Check that you are settled,
and take time in the beginning to get rid of any last fidgets.
 
2 .  Start to observe your breath. Choose the most obvious place in your
body for you to notice the breath.
 
3 .  Start to count your breaths. Every third time you breathe, mentally
say to yourself, “May my body and mind be at ease.”
 
4 .  Every fourth breath, mentally repeat the phrase, “May all beings be at
ease in body and mind.”
 
5 .  Continue this practice for five minutes, or much longer if you have
time. Before you finish, notice how you are feeling. This practice
expands your heart and allows you to feel connected by the swirling
energy of love and goodwill to your family, community and beyond.

HEYAM DUKHAM ANAGATAM
ह ेय ं   ख ं  अ न ग त ं
Yoga Sutras II:17
This sutra literally translates as “to prevent suffering which has not
yet arrived”. It tells us that while we can’t change our past, we do
have some potential to change the future, by whatever action we
consciously choose in the present. Importantly, it reminds us that
we must act now, to anticipate and avoid undesirable future
consequences.
This is incredibly empowering to take on board: right now, in
this present moment, is the only time you can influence what
comes next. In addition, only if your mind is in a state of clarity will
your thought-processes initiate action that will not leave any
residue. Any residue will manifest as dukham , or suffering.
Naturally, we cannot achieve this state of perfect action
overnight, or without effort. But most (or all) of us would prefer to
reduce the potential for future suffering. Start with something
simple that is not too challenging. Set a goal and check your
progress in a short span of time, such as a week.
This is another area where we are struck by an interesting
paradox: we are already perfect as we are. Yet, as a human
being, being perfect in that imperfection is again very apparent.
There is no one human who does not act imperfectly at least
occasionally, so if your ideal is to live a life completely free from
suffering, you will be setting yourself an impossible goal. With this
in mind, it’s useful to understand how you can practically reduce
at least the frequency, if not the intensity, of your suffering that is
yet to come.
When considering the suffering of the future, you need to
determine a couple of things. The first is to figure out which
scenarios are merely an invention of your mind – those things that
you worry about, but which will probably never happen. Don’t let
yourself be tormented by any of those unlikely future scenarios.
On the other hand, you do need to consider carefully the likely
outcomes of your current actions. This sutra reminds us to act
now, in order to avoid pain in the future. It’s the original concept of
the adage “an ounce of prevention is better than cure”. It’s not
rocket science – if you always do what you always do, you’re
always going to get what you always get. So this sutra reminds us
to be both responsible and responsive.
Using this sutra can guide you in making choices that better
serve you, such as what you choose to eat, the work you choose
to do and how you do it. It is helpful when examining how you
choose to exercise, and even when you need to back off from
doing certain things that you might usually think of as healthy –
such as doing weight-bearing yoga poses when your wrist is sore.
This sutra helps you in your relationships with the people
around you that you know and love, and with those far away
whom you will never even meet or really know about. It
encompasses the rest of the world, too. Act consciously and with
integrity, as this sutra guides your actions concerning the
environment. Be thoughtful about what you buy, cut down on
over-consumption, and recycle. Make decisions based on more
than short-term security or economic goals.

Here are five themed flows to kick-start your practice. These
sequences will all offer you a nicely balanced practice. It is
important to always factor in feedback from your body as you
practice. At some point, you will feel ready to get creative and
form your own sequences. As you do so, keep in mind that your
body doesn’t speak English, Spanish or Japanese. It has its
own special language – the language of sensation. So be sure
to attune yourself to the sensations of your body as you
practice. Gather feedback from it during and after each pose.
This “listening” to your body will guide you in selecting the next
posture. That might be moving from a more active posture to a
softer, soothing one. Perhaps it will be selecting a posture along
the same path – moving from, say, a gentle forward bend to a
deeper forward fold. Or maybe your body will ask for a pose
that opposes the previous posture to help it balance out, such
as taking a restful child’s pose after an active inversion, or
following a backbend with a twist. As you listen to the
sensations of your body and respond to them, your yoga
practice becomes truly yours. And it will feel like a pleasant,
helpful and open conversation between good friends. Enjoy!

NAMASTE न म   त े
This traditional Indian greeting is often used to close a yoga
class. It comes from two words: Namas , which means
“bowing”; and Te , meaning “to you”. Most concisely it means “I
bow down to you.” But it runs deeper than that. Namaste
means there is a special flame or divinity within each of us. And
in salutation we acknowledge this spirit and bow down to honour
the unique spirits in each other.
Its essence can be expanded out to the profound and
bonding understanding that we are all of the same divine
consciousness:

acknowledgements
Thank you, Jerry, for your cheerful support – you insist you are
soulless, yet your soulful and steady natural yogi state supports me
more than you can know. To my shiny-eyed, joyful Safia, thanks for
her patience with Mummy’s last 30 pages of the book. You are my
mirror, who shines a light on my life, and I love you more than words
can ever express. And to my precious bundle of cuddly love, Asha,
your occasional 4am alarm bell helped this book to get written. At
any time of the day or night, you will always make my heart swell.
Good childcare can make all the difference to a mum. Every class I
teach is a little creation in itself, and this book was a slightly more
time-consuming one. My heartfelt thanks to Madeleine Geist,
Jennifer Kollmann and Yutika U-Pongthong (Noona), who allowed
me some time away from putting Vegemite on toast and freed me
up to create. Maddie was in our lives as I opened Transform, my
latest yoga studio, when my youngest daughter was not quite two.
Jenny was there with her wonderful supportive energy as the
business grew enough to enable me to even consider this
endeavour. And Noona took such good care of my little ones, and
us, during the writing of this book.
Thanks to all those around the world who bought the original classic,
The Yoga Bible, and therefore made the creation of this book
possible.
To all my students: you make it possible for me to do what I love,
and even to make a living from it. How lucky am I?!
Thanks to Kristen Blackwell, Em Cruikshank and Rosemary Bekker,
for checking that I actually wrote in English, not “yoga”. Kristen knew
me before I knew her, from having owned a copy of The Yoga Bible
in America, and then, by my good fortune, turned out to be an
excellent next-door neighbour in Sydney. Rosie, your weekly check-
ins over chai tea are cherished. Em sets an auspicious vibe in her
gorgeous yin classes.
Lunches with fellow writers Mischa Telford and Jayne Tancred
offered clarity on the curvy pathway to planning out this book, and
their wise words dissolved a couple of hurdles on the path forward.
Thank you, Mischa, for your excellent yoga history and philosophy
support. I always love your briliant analogies and fascinating
observations.
Thanks to Louise and Richard G for their writing space with a view.
Thanks to our yogi and yogini models Emi Takahashi Tull, Paul
Anderson, Daniel Breakwell (dbreakyoga.com ), Anne Thomson
(http://annethomson314.wixsite.com/anne-thomson-yoga ), Meera
Anderson (manifestingdestiny.com.au ) and Richard James Allen
(physicaltv.com.au ) for making the shoot flow. Thank you to the
wonderful Melanie DeSylva for beautiful hair and the fabulous
Wendy Smith and Kristy and Andrew Pownell for wardrobe support.
In any life – ancient or modern – there is suffering. Yet in its way,
sadness is life-affirming. To my niece Laura Acton, a blossom, who
we all achingly miss: you would just have been turning 21 now. Your
presence lives with us every day and you remind me what is
important in life.
