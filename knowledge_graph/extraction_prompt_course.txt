Following is a few Yoga training courses. I need your help to convert to JSON format with new schema.

==== 
An example course:
{
  "course":
  {
    "power flow": {
      "challenge": "2",
      "introduction": "Use the Three-Legged Dog between each of the standing postures and between each side of the standing postures. For example, when you first come into Exultant Warrior Flow, you’ll take your left leg up and then lunge it forward. Return to Classic Downward-Facing Dog Pose after that side, then take your right leg up to lunge it forward for the second side of your Warrior. Set your holds in the static poses to suit you; three to five breaths is good. Use the Ocean Breath throughout this sequence, until you get to the relaxation and meditation at the end.",
      "steps": [
        "Spine Mobilizer",
        "Strengthening Sun Salutation x 3–6",
        "Three-Legged Dog – left leg up – into lunge with left foot forward",
        "Exultant Warrior Flow",
        "Three-Legged Dog – right leg up – into lunge with right foot forward – ",
        "Exultant Warrior Flow on right side",
        "Three-Legged Dog",
        "Shoulder-Stretching Triangle Pose",
        "Three-Legged Dog – into lunge",
        "Standing Splits",
        "Three-Legged Dog – into lunge",
        "Shoulder-Releasing Eagle",
        "Open Squat Twist",
        "East–West Flow",
        "Inclined Plane Pose",
        "Intense Reclining Side-Stretch",
        "Dancing Bridge",
        "Plough-Pose Lifts",
        "Three-Up Bridge Pose",
        "Shoulder-Stand (your choice of Starter, Basic or Variations)",
        "Neck Releases after Inversions",
        "Reclining Eagle Twist",
        "Half-Lotus Balance",
        "Head-Beyond-the-Knee Pose",
        "Peaceful Mind Relaxation",
        "Mindfulness Meditation"
      ],
      "attribute": "Yang",
      "category": "Putting it all together"
    }
  }

Below is the new course schema which I am trying to convert the courses by following with.

{
    "name": (the course name),
    "challenge": (1-3)
    "description": (explanantion of the course contents and characteristics),
    "sequence": [
        {
          "pose": (pose name),
          "duration_seconds": (duration of the pose in seconds),
          "repeat_times": (how many times to repeat the pose. The total duration in this pose will multiply duration_seconds),
          "transition_notes": (notes about how to transition to next pose or between two repetition of the same pose (e.g., left and right). )
        }
    ]
}

Please convert all the sample courses accordinly. I have no idea about the duration_seconds for each pose, and repeat times in the course sequence. Please use your knowledge and search for the suggested values. If you have no value available, please give minimum 30s to the duration_seconds and 1 to the repeat_times. Note, flow poses usually consist of multiple postures and may have left and right sides, so will either take more than 30 seconds for one pose or take more than 1 repeat times.

The transition_notes are about how to transition to next pose or between two repetitions (like right and left transition). They are not about the pose itself, but about transitioning. 
Please use your knowledge and search for better numbers and notes.

Some logics just for your references, you don't have to follow:
Duration Logic:
 - Active Poses: 30-90s (based on pose complexity)
 - Yin/Holds: 2-5 minutes
 - Meditation: 3-5 minutes
 - Flows: 1-3 minutes per cycle

Repeat Strategy:
 - Bilateral poses: repeat_times:1 + "per side" in notes
 - Cyclic flows: Midpoint of original "x3–6" instructions
 - Strength sequences: 3-5 reps for endurance

Transition Notes:
 - Alignment cues ("Engage glutes", "Microbend knees")
 - Breath coordination ("Inhale expand/exhale release")
 - Modifications ("Use strap/block/wall")

Challenge Levels:
- Converted to numbers (1=Beginner, 2=Intermediate)
- Matched to pose difficulty and hold times

Please use your knowledge and search for better numbers (duration_seconds, repeat_times) and transition_notes.

If you cannot finish all the courses below, please finish the first few, and let me know how many courses you have finished. I will finish the remaining ones later. For the finished course, make sure not to miss any steps. Keeping all the steps complete as the original are most important in the conversion!
