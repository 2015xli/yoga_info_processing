      "introduction": "What’s not to love about this beautiful heart-opening sequence? Your breathing will slow and deepen, increasing the vital capacity of your lungs and building your “bank account” balance of pranic energy. And your spine will lengthen and maintain flexibility, as it arcs forward and back, keeping you feeling fresh, light and young – and, yes, joyful.",
      "steps": [
        "Sit on your heels with your big toes touching and your knees wide apart. Bring your palms together in prayer. This first time, before you begin to move, take some time to notice the shape of your spine as you sit here. Observe how your tailbone tucks lightly under, then notice the sacrum bone – that broad plate of bone leading to your lower back. Enjoy the long inward arch of your lower back, and how the mid- and upper back round softly outward. Finally, notice how your neck curves inward a little. Enjoy the way your head balances easily on the very top vertebrae. Just acknowledging these parts can allow tensions to melt away.",
        "Take a breath in, then interlace your fingers and, turning your palms forward, exhale as you press away through the heels of the hands. At the same time, use your abdominals to help you tuck your tailbone under strongly, then round your upper back. Really go for it, with this action. Press out actively with your palms to help you cleave the shoulder blades away from each other. You want to create the maximum distance between your upper back vertebrae and your hands.",
        "Catch the wave of your next inhalation and sweep your arms up to vertical, or even further back, reaching beyond vertical. As you do this, change the shape of your spine to a long concave shape. Strongly tilt your pelvis forward. Your chestbone will lift as you create a tall backbend and you will feel a great shoulder stretch. You want to enliven the whole of your spine, so focus on doing a little less with the neck vertebrae while feeling more in the spine from the neck down.",
        "As you exhale, take your arms and fingers out wide to the side. Keep your spine in a backbend shape and reach the arms as far back as possible, to get a stretch across the chest muscles. Make the movement slow, so that it lasts as long as your entire exhalation does. Inhale again as you float your palms together in prayer in front of your chest. As your spine returns to its normal four curves, allow the softness to come into it and into the whole body. Repeat this breathing sequence five to ten more times."

At the same time, curve your spine into a downward arch as you feed your chest through your upper arms. Allow your neck vertebrae to join the rest of the spine in this backbend, but as the neck is already flexible, place your mental emphasis more on the rest of the spine, particularly the thoracic vertebrae of the mid- and upper back.",
        "Exhale as you round the spine in the opposite direction and bring your right knee into your chest. Feel your abdominals drawing inward, toward the spine, as you push the floor away with your hands. Continue for several rounds. Inhale to concave your spine. Exhale to curve it up with your right leg, reaching out like the tail of a tiger, then drawing in.",
        "Add the arm-strengthening work from the backbend position, with your leg still lifted behind. To work your triceps, ensure your inner- elbow creases are facing forward, then bend both elbows backward and lower them toward the floor. Ensure both upper-arm bones are parallel as you do this, and that the elbows do not splay apart. Straighten your arms, keeping your right foot at exactly the same height as it was, so that you get a beautiful squeezy feeling in the kidney area. Keep your hip position fixed – check your hips are not moving backward as you lower yourself down (you won’t feel that good triceps-muscle burn if they are). Complete eight push-ups, exhaling down and inhaling up. Then bring the knee into the chest once again before lowering it down to the floor. You are now ready for your left side."

You are not at your work desk now – remember: moving fast in yoga is not more efficient. Take your time and enjoy the lazy exhalation.",
        "When you feel your inhale begin, lift your right hand up into the air and rise up onto your knees again. Create a huge circle, to return your fingers to their starting position on the floor out in front. Exhaling, begin your next circle by sliding backward once again. Lock your gaze onto your moving thumb for the whole circle. As your right arm approaches the vertical, push your left palm firmly down and see if you can feel the rebound “bounce” that enables your right arm to reach one notch higher. Continue for five or more rounds. Then sit up and feel the difference in the two halves of your torso. Most likely your right side will feel looser, warmer, more open and relaxed. Repeat on the left side."

You will be able to straighten them a little more toward the end. If it’s easy to maintain your anterior pelvic tilt, play with anchoring yourself during the sequence by keeping the backs of your knees pressed toward the earth and flexing your feet, to pull your toes back toward your torso. Inhale and interlace your fingers, reaching your arms forward and all the way up. Press the heels of the hands away. Enjoy the sensations of your back muscles squeezing, and notice how your heart centre elevates.",

Then exhale, revolve your abdomen to the right side and, still on the same long exhalation, drop the hands down to chest level and then reach both arms and torso forward over your right leg. Try to line up your chestbone with your thigh bone. Don’t drop the head; instead, reach out and away through the crown of the head every time you fold forward.",

Then breathe in to come up and, on your next exhale, twist left and fold over your left leg. Inhale to return to centre. Exhale to fold forward again. Continue working through the centre and the sides, four times each. To take the load off the lower back, bend the elbows, so that the hands travel near your heart as you move into and out of each forward bend.

Exhaling while lifting the limbs may feel a bit counter-intuitive, but it will help activate the abdomen and stabilize the pose. Repeat six rounds as you inhale to touch down, then exhale to lift up again. While the arm extends out and away, be sure to anchor the top of the arm into its root, creating a feeling of bringing the head of the upper arm bone into the shoulder girdle. Draw your right shoulder blade down toward your left hip to accentuate this feeling.",

Your lower back already knows how to bend backward, so mentally emphasize the backbend in the thoracic spine. Move your chestbone forward and up. Then lift the left foot higher, to feel more of a stretch in your quadriceps. After five to ten long breaths, come out. You are now ready for side two."

As it is an upright posture, you can sneak this shoulder-soother into your day just about anywhere, to give those tight shoulders a break.

Work the legs by activating your front thigh muscles to lift your kneecaps. Take a long inhalation and extend from your ankle bones all the way up to your elbows. Feel the two side-lines of your body come alive. Continue the reach up to your left fingers. As you exhale, sway your torso to the left. Increase the shoulder stretch by moving your left arm away from your left ear.",

Inhale to grow tall, and once again exhale to curve to the left. Sway your arm as far wide as possible. Remember to imprint your feet nicely into the ground. Inhale to come back up. If possible, grasp your left deltoid (shoulder- cap) muscles with your right hand. If your head has been pressed forward, move the back of the skull backward to realign your head to neutral. Inhale, grow tall again, then exhale and for the third time lean to the left. Reach out with your left arm and sway it away from the head. Inhale to lift up and return to standing in Mountain Pose, with the arms by your side. Take some time to notice how and where your body has released, before you start side two."

        "You can start this pose on hands and knees, but the first few times you practise it, here’s how to find out what spacing suits you best. Lie face-down on the floor. Bend your elbows up to place your palms on the floor at chest level with your thumbs at nipple level.",
        "Without changing the position of your palms or knees, push up onto your hands and knees. With your knees and feet hip-width apart, spread your fingers and thumbs wide and tuck your toes under. Now set up the forward tilt for your pelvis for this pose, by lifting your sitting bones and letting your abdomen drop, as you accentuate the downward curve in your lower back.",
        "Check that your palms are shoulder-width apart and press into the floor. Maintaining the forward pelvic tilt, lift your knees and send the hips up and back. Stay on tiptoes and keep a bend in your knees so you will be able to bring your spine to a fairly straight position. You want to send the hips energetically up away from the wrists, as far back and high as possible. Have your ears positioned between the upper arms, to keep your neck in a neutral position. Ensure that your chin is not tucked in, which would flatten the neck, and don’t create any wrinkles in the back of your neck, due to over-arching it.",
        "To maintain that lumbar curve, take your time straightening your legs and lowering the heels toward the floor. Contract your quadriceps muscles, so that the kneecaps lift. It’s not the aim of this pose to have your heels on the floor: instead, aim to get maximum length through the back of the body. It’s great to have a little space between the heels and the floor. Ensure that the index finger and thumb knuckles are well anchored down. Now roll your shoulders out, so that you broaden the shoulder blades away from each other: imagine that you have an eye in each armpit and you want to look cross-eyed. Hold and enjoy for five to ten breaths, then rest. If your wrists start to ache, then that’s enough of this pose for the day; aim to build up your strength over time."

Now rotate your chest and belly to the right, allowing your right shoulder to lift slightly. Tuck your chin in and look up under the right armpit. Now try twisting the less-obvious way, by turning your head and chest to the left, while dropping your right shoulder and lifting your left. If you reinforce your right hip to maintain its lift and keep reaching through the right knee, you can create a marvellous sense of release in the abdominal muscles. It can feel as if this pose is working even deeper than just on this muscular level – as if even the organs of the abdomen get more space, as they float in upside-down suspension."

You can then “drive” your right palm downward while you resist with the left. This will rotate your torso further into the twist. Stay for several long breaths, then progress to the lunge.",
        "Looking down, lift your left heel. If you can, lift the whole foot to hover in the air. Send your leg back to take a long, deep lunge position. Continue pressing the palms together to allow the torso to twist deeply.",
        "If you can, bring the shoulders into play. Lean further forward and lower your left shoulder to lock against your right outer knee. Bending at the elbow, rotate your left palm backward, then slide the back of the hand under your right thigh. Reach your right arm up to vertical, and turn from the shoulder so that the thumb points downward. Bring that arm down past the lower back and catch the fingers or grasp the right wrist. Looking up, deepen the twist by attempting to straighten your elbows. Reach your knuckles away so that your hands no longer touch your body. Stay for five breaths, then repeat on the second side."

Look back at your right foot and press down through its little-toe edge. As you do this, lift the inner arch of the right foot slightly. You may experience a subtle lift of the inner knee and thigh away from the floor. Take your left foot wider and continue to ease your left knee forward, aiming to have it bent to 90 degrees. Once you have got your legs generously wide, bring in the shoulder action. Check that you feel safe and that your legs feel stable. There must be no sense of “losing” the grounding on the back foot or the lifting action along the back leg, because they provide a vital anchor. Interlace your fingers behind your back. Turn your belly and chest toward the ground and lower your whole torso to the floor. Bowing the head down, take your arms up and over. Let the reaching away with your knuckles lift your shoulders away from your ears. If you feel you want to take the legs wider, do so safely – take your fingertips to the floor first, to steady yourself.

        "Come into your basic Tree Pose: from standing, ground down through the right foot and bend your left knee up. Take hold of your left ankle, and position your foot as high up your right inner thigh as possible while avoiding the knee joint. The lower the foot is, the easier it is to balance. Press the sole of your foot against your inner thigh, while at the same time resisting back with the inner thigh toward the sole of the foot. This will keep you feeling more stable. Touch your thumbs to your index fingers and take your arms up to the sides, elbows bent and palms facing up.",
        "Now curve your Tree. Tilt your torso over to the left, so that your left elbow moves closer to the left knee. Keep your elbow “branches” wide and back, and sigh your shoulders away from your ears. Maintain a light and regular breathing rhythm as you hold for five to ten breaths.",
        "Come upright and make your twisty_tree. First twist to your right, away from your bent knee. Firm your abdominal muscles to help you revolve as deeply as possible. Notice how your breathing changes. After several breaths, return to the centre and revolve to your left. This might feel more satisfying, as you can go further. Again, it’s your core muscles that will pull you around most obviously, but do appreciate the working of the back muscles, too. After several breaths, return to the centre. Come back onto two feet, re-centre and practise side two."

      "introduction": "In this modern take on the Eagle, your lower body will work extra-hard to stay stable despite the challenge of the upper-body movements. I like it, as it feels like tricking your tight shoulders into softening as they respond to the flowing movements of your arms. It’s about having an undemanding attitude to these gentler gliding stretches, which avoid the harsh demands of a long hold.",
      "steps": [
        "From standing, bend both knees. Lift your left knee up and take it across your right thigh. If you can, wrap your leg all the way around, so that your left ankle locks behind your right calf. If that movement isn’t possible for you, take your left ankle to your right thigh, just near the knee. Once you have found your leg position, bend your standing leg deeply and tilt forward from the hips, to get more release in the gluteal muscles. Extend your arms out wide and begin to travel your left arm down and your right arm up. As you come toward vertical with each arm, bend the elbows to bring your hands together behind your back. Hook the fingers together. If your hands can’t reach each other, get as close as you can for today – time and practice will take care of that, so smile that you are here now, patiently enjoying the journey as tensions dissolve.",
        "Once this movement is complete, switch your arms to the second side. Release your finger grasp, and straighten both elbows. Inhale to circle both arms long and wide, as your left arm floats up while your right arm sinks. Exhale as both elbows bend and the fingers reclaim their grasp. Don’t be surprised if one side feels stiffer than the other – I tell my students it just means they are a human being who has lived. Accept your asymmetries, smile kindly upon yourself and keep practising.",
        "Stay balancing on one leg as you continue to move in time with your breath. Inhale as you circle to reach your arms vertically up and down, then exhale to bend and clasp. Set up a slow flow, alternating from side to side, while your shoulders soften in their acceptance of the stretches. After about eight rounds, come back to standing on two feet. Take some time to note where your body has released."

Bend your front knee to a right-angle (or as close as you can) to come into a lunge. Now interlace your fingers behind your back. Roll your shoulders strongly back, and wrinkle up the skin between your shoulder blades. Lift your arms and hands as high as possible and ensure your elbows are really straight. Elevate your ribcage away from your waist and, in particular, lift up through your chestbone to create a glorious backbend shape. This is a classic Warrior I posture, with a great shoulder variation to work on tight shoulders.",
        "Take a small step forward with your back foot, coming up to tiptoes. Lean your torso forward slightly, so that you come out of the backbend. Contract your abdominal muscles, creating a muscular connection between your lowest ribs in front and your hip bones. This will help enormously during your one-legged balancing. Tilt forward some more, as you lift your back leg all the way up to horizontal. Your right hip will probably have lifted, compared to your left, so drop it down so that you are flat across your sacrum. In flying_warrior, continue to reach your knuckles away with energy to stretch the fronts of both shoulders.",
        "If you can, take this pose upside-down. Squeeze on your abdominals and, lengthening out from the tailbone, tilt forward at the hips. If you don’t travel far, bend your standing leg to go further. On your flying leg, squeeze on the muscles of the front thigh to reach it further up and away. Fan out the toes of the right foot. Reach your arms up and over as far as they will go. Be like a bicycle wheel – from the centre of your pelvis, radiate your “spokes” out and away strongly in three directions: up and over with the arms, grounding down with the standing leg, and up and away with the flying leg. Stay for five breaths and then, with control, return to step 1. Bring your feet together and change sides."

Bend into your left knee and come up onto your fingertips, to give the torso clearance for the next move. As you inhale first lift the chest up, then twist your belly strongly to the left, to line up your chestbone with your left thigh bone. Then, when you exhale, you can lay your chest on your thigh, possibly straightening that leg to warm up for the stronger hamstring stretch that is coming. Bend your left knee again and move your right fingertips about 30cm (12in) in front of your big toe, keeping your hand to the right of the foot. Wrap your left forearm against your left calf, elbow bent, so that your forearm is vertical and your hand wraps above the heel.

Ensure both legs are super-straight and send that flying leg up to vertical. Squeeze the muscles of the front thigh, to help lift it even more. If you can, instead of looking down, untuck your chin and look across on the horizontal. Keep working to “glue” your belly and chest to your thigh. And last but not least, breathe! After five or more breaths, come down lightly and with control. Walk your hands across to the right and adjust your feet, ready for side two.",

As you reach the right foot up and back to create your Dancer’s pose, tip your torso forward. Reach your left arm out in front, palm up. Place the tips of your thumb and index-finger together. Each time you practise dancers_bow you can alternate between having your standing leg bent or, as shown, straight. Remind yourself that good balancing doesn’t mean holding a shape perfectly still.

Now add in a stretch for the left side of your neck. Lightly tuck in your chin and revolve your head to look down the front of your right shoulder.

Interlace your fingers, and then pull both hands around to the right side of your waist. Take a few mindful, yet firm pulls, to ease both sets of knuckles forward. You may be able to draw both hands to the front of your body. If possible, close both wrists toward each other. Ensure your torso doesn’t twist off to one side, and keep it facing square-on to the front. Do your best to maintain a neutral spine position, too, resisting the tendency to move into a backbend shape. Now roll both shoulders back and squeeze your elbows toward each other. Stay here for five to ten breaths.",
        "For the next step, add in a neat little neck release. Turn your head to look to the right. Draw your chin toward your throat so that your eyes will look down, then release it so that your eyes look out horizontal again. Set up a nodding action by repeating the chin tuck- and-release a few more times. Then return your head to centre, and bring your arms to your sides. Notice any changes that have occurred in your neck and shoulders. Then repeat on the second side."

Flow together your backward and forward movements and breaths a few more times.",

As both arms complete their circles to reach up overhead, your body returns to vertical. Continue for five or more rounds with the arms circling in this direction.",
        "The next time both arms meet overhead, change directions to circle your arms the opposite way. As you complete five or more rounds, remind yourself that you are doing this to soften your tight shoulders. So soften your brain a little, too. Sometimes we over-think things. Remove all that mental tension of trying too hard – just relax and have fun."

As you do this, snuggle your left fingers up your back, as if they were trying to tickle the back of your neck.",

Choose your most- relaxed leg position: you can bend your knees up or lengthen them out along the floor. Rest your right arm on the floor. Now use your breathing to get deeper into the stretch. Inhale light and warmth into your shoulder, and exhale away any tensions. If you sense that your shoulder can go one step further, roll your left shoulder back to increase the sensation. Stay here for one or two minutes. Roll to the right side to come out and sit up. When you practise the second side, remember that while your body may have tightened up in response to life’s impacts, it is doing the very best it can for you. Be grateful for all its good efforts."

Step your left leg back about 60cm (2ft) and turn your foot out by 15 degrees. Bend your front knee and fold forward to place your elbows on the support, shoulder-width apart. Then bring your palms together with fingers pointing upward. Ease your hips back, so that your back comes to a flat shape. Position your head so that your ears are between your upper arms. The more you can move your hips back and create that long, flat feeling in your spine, the easier it will be for your head to clear the ledge. If you can, straighten your front knee and deepen the crease where your right thigh joins your torso. This will allow your right hip to move backward a little, which will keep the hips square. Stay here for eight or more breaths.",

Press your top elbow down while pushing up with your lower elbow for several breaths. Again, with even resistance, you won’t move outwardly, but you may well feel a good release in the shoulders. Repeat the horizontal and vertical pressure-squeezes, if you like. Finally, let go of the contraction work. Lift both elbows higher and straighten them as much as you can, without losing the upper-arm lock. Mentally direct your breath into the space between your shoulder blades to help this area soften and open. Add in a forward fold to awaken the hips.

Roll your shoulders back, so that you broaden across your collar bones. This is an important action that you will aim to maintain for the whole sequence. Keep your shoulders nicely set by drawing your shoulder blades together slightly, as if magnetized. Lift your navel toward your spine. At the same time, create a sense of drawing your hip bones toward each other, across the front of the abdomen. Lift your right leg in the air behind you.

Think about going forward, rather than down to the ground. How much you lower is up to you. It’s fine to drop just a little in the beginning. At your deepest you will create right-angles at the wrists and elbows. Straighten your arms to complete your push-up. Ensure your abdomen doesn’t sag as you lift up. Check that your shoulders haven’t rolled in, either. If you start to roll your shoulders in, then you have reached fatigue point and that means your body has had enough of this practice – work on it another day instead, and you will build up strength for deeper drops and more repetitions. Repeat five to ten more push-ups, paying attention to your form. Rest, and then complete a second set with your left leg lifted.",

Still with knees bent, work on finding the length from your pubic bone to your throat. On each inhalation your ribcage will float up a bit, which will create a little space.

Sometimes we round the back and shut the breathing down a little in forward bends, but with the hands in front, you have a great opportunity to minimize that. You can use yoga blocks to help your body open further: walk your hands further forward to allow a really pleasant long and “flat” feeling along the front of the torso. If you don’t have props handy, you can take your hands to the seat of a chair placed in front of you. After ten or more breaths, bend the knees and inhale to come up. Stand quietly to feel the effects of this pose."

It’s nice to open your feet apart, so that the big toes move away from each other like the pages of an open book. As you do this, allow the knees to move apart. This widening action is what will best allow the knees to lower to the floor, rather than trying to force them straight down.",

It’s nice to maintain the thigh bones where they are, so think about the hip sockets moving forward around the head of the bones. If you can maintain the inward curve of the lower back, you can bring your fingertips to the floor in front and walk them away as you deepen the forward fold. If you find that your pelvis tilts backward as you let go of the floor behind you, you aren’t yet ready for hands in front. Stay where you are for five to ten breaths.",

Starting with the hands behind once again, follow the same steps, moving into your deepest forward tilt. If you can, take your hands forward and walk them out front. Stay for five or ten long breaths, or for as long as you enjoy it. The come up and practise the other side."

If that’s not manageable, grab your ankle or shin, or loop a soft belt around your instep and hold that. If it feels comfortable, slide your left foot away, to add in a stretch for your left hip and thigh. Place your left palm on the top of that left thigh, to encourage it to ease down to the floor. Otherwise, keep your left knee bent up as you continue to step 2.",
        "Now it’s time to play with the resistance, which will bring a whole new quality to your stretch. Attempt to straighten your right knee while you continue to place pressure on your right heel. Try to bend your right elbow and, as you resist by pressing away with the leg, allow the leg to “win”. Straighten the leg as much as you comfortably can, but maintain the resistance with your arm. This should feel like a deep but healthy stretch. After about ten breaths, come out and repeat this sequence on the second side.",

Then settle into symmetry and enjoy your breathing. If your knees are close to the floor, add a degree of difficulty by bringing your pelvis into a forward tilt, as if to aim your tailbone closer to the floor and as if to pull your lower back away from the floor and into its natural curved shape.

Flex your ankle so that the “blade” of the foot – the little-toe edge – is in contact with the floor. If your hips are more open, bring your heel in toward your groin. In this position, more of the top of the foot will touch the ground. This option will allow for a deep release in the right side of the lower back. After choosing your leg option, take your left hand behind you, and bring your right hand to the outer left thigh or knee. Inhale and float your spine tall as you twist to the left. The lower back will rotate better for you if it’s in its natural convex shape, so be sure to press into the floor with your left hand to assist this curve. Squeeze your abdominal muscles toward the left, so that your pubic bone moves a little to the left. Stay in this upright twist for five to ten breaths.",

If you are flexible enough to reach, clasp your right wrist with your left hand and have the palm of the right hand facing away from you.

Take your left hand to your right outer knee and your right fingertips to the floor behind your back. Draw yourself up to create a dignified elegance. Then you will be ready to twist to the right.

Find your beautiful alignment before you deepen the intensity: taking an inhalation, lift your front ribs up and away from your hips. This will create space in your body and help flatten your back.

Place your right arm across your knees, to remind the hip and thigh muscles to soften. Then find the most luxurious position for your left arm. You can bend the elbow and place your palm on your ribs, but most people like to have their back arm out to the side, palm up. To give the side of your torso a little more release, slide your arm higher up so that it’s closer to your ear. Now seek out the nicest way to position your head and neck.

Consider the usual suspects – back, shoulders, neck – but also roam freely. Is there any tension holding in the soles of the feet? How are the buttocks? What about your jaw? Bringing awareness to tight or tender areas starts the path of healing and softening. To move into a feeling of actively spiralling, lift your feet up, angling your shins to point both knees downward. This will activate the oblique muscles of your core. Recommit your left shoulder to the floor. This will also impact on your breathing – it might feel shorter or less smooth. Bring mindfulness to your breath so that it can round out more.

      "introduction": "The four-step process detailed here can be used in every twist you will ever attempt, and it will really take your twisting to a whole new level. You always want to elongate the spine first, and you generally want to twist from your base up. Go forth and conquer the marvellous world of twists.",
      "steps": [
        "Sit in an easy cross-legged pose. If you feel stiff, sit on a cushion to lift your hips in relation to your knees. If cross-legged doesn’t work for you, try kneeling with your knees apart or together. Cup your right knee with your left hand and find a good spot on the floor, somewhere out from your tailbone, to place your right palm or fingertips. The first step of your twist is to think about your lower abdomen. Elongate as you take a full inhalation, then on an exhale switch on your abdominal muscles and direct them firmly to the right. Notice how far you move during this first stage of your rotation. It will be a combination of strength in the torso muscles and the work of both arms.",
        "Inhale and draw yourself tall once again. As you exhale, squeeze the upper abdomen around to the right to rotate further. Keep your belly muscles on, so that they draw inward to your centre.",
        "Your abdomen will feel tight and strong, so you will feel your next inhalation more in the chest. As you breathe in, allow the chest to lift, and then exhale and move it as much as possible into your twist.",
        "Finally, think of your shoulders. Inhale and lengthen from tailbone to crown, then exhale and move both shoulders further into the twist. On an exhalation, come out of the twist – as you do so, you may feel a release of pressure, like opening a bottle of sparkling water. Enjoy these bubbles of release while you sit symmetrically. Then work with the second side, again working from bottom to top. Try this four-step bottom-to-top process in other twists, such as the cow_pose_spirals ."

        "For Sage Pose, first sit and bring both feet around to the left. Have the toes of your left foot pointing straight back, and place your right foot over the instep of the left. You will feel a natural tipping to the right, so do your best to snuggle your left buttock down toward the floor. If you feel too lopsided, level the hips more by lifting your seat. To level out, sit on a folded blanket or a yoga block. Rotating to your right side, take your left hand to the right knee and position your right fingertips on the floor behind you. Use your arms as levers to help you come into a deep and satisfying twist.",
        "Once you are settled in your twist, set up your first neck stretch. Starting from a neutral head position, where your jawline is parallel to the floor, rotate your head to the right so that you are looking behind you. Ensure it feels comfortable. Now, tilt your head by dropping your right earlobe down to your right shoulder. Bring your chin closer to your throat. Now squeeze on the muscles by your armpits, to lower your left shoulder. Experience a fairly strong diagonal line of stretch along the left side of your neck. If you wish, create a tiny nodding action. Stay for three to five long breaths.",
        "Stay in the twist, but return your head and neck to a neutral position. Keeping a sense of elongation in the neck, swivel your head to the left, so that you are looking over your left shoulder. First tilt the face downward a small amount, tucking the chin in. Then drop your left ear down. Accentuate the stretch along the neck and back shoulder by lowering the right shoulder. Hold for five breaths, then release the head to neutral. Come out of the twist and stretch your legs out in front of you. Take a moment to check in with how your neck feels. Then swing your legs to the right, ready to practise the second side."

Place your feet a little wider than your shoulders and turn your toes out. This will allow your knees to ease away from each other, so that you get an inner-thigh stretch as well. Hold your left shin, ankle or, if possible, foot with your left hand. Tap your right hand to your left, then reach your right hand out and up in a wide arc.",
        "Make sure your abdominal section is involved in this twist. Your core muscles will switch on, to help the rotation from your solar plexus. Combined with the elevating reach of your right arm, you may feel a diagonal pull as the upper right part of your abdomen moves away from your lower left side. Anchor yourself by pressing your left arm to your left leg. Then come alive through your centre, as you continue to radiate your right arm up and away. Hold for five to ten breaths, then rest.",
        "To come into the loop, slide your left armpit down to your left inner thigh, just before the knee. It will feel as if this shortens the left side of the torso, but it’s all part of the contract-and-release benefits of a twist: some parts of you will condense, others will expand. Once your left shoulder is as low as it can go, rotate from your shoulder in order to slide your left forearm under your left thigh, then bring the back of your hand across until it rests on your sacrum.",
        "With your lower arm locked in place, reach your upper arm up and away, as in step 1. Rotating from the shoulder, turn your right thumb forward and down. As you bend your elbow up, bring your right hand low, to slide the back of it across your lower back. Curl your fingers to lock the hands together or, if you can, grasp your right wrist with your left hand. If you can’t reach, complete the loop between both hands by holding a soft belt.",
        "To add that extra bit to your twist, and to accentuate the shoulder and hip stretches, send a current of energy through both elbows to straighten them. As you do this, move your hands away from your body, so that eventually your hands don’t touch your body at all. Stay for five breaths. Then repeat on the second side."

Your left elbow will bend on this downward movement, allowing you to snuggle your right shoulder to the floor.

        "To move into the fully threaded_needle, you will be bringing your right arm through your inner thighs. Set up this movement from your all-fours starting position by rolling your right shoulder forward, so that your elbow lifts up and your palm faces right. As you slide your forearm through the legs, the blade of the little-finger end of your hand will be closest to the floor. Bend your left elbow to allow your head and right shoulder to rest to the floor. Slide the back of your right hand as high up as possible, to rest against your right buttock. Now lift your left arm up into the air and, rotating through the shoulder, bend the elbow and turn your palm backward, thumb down. Slide the back of the hand across your lower back and lock the fingers of both hands. A common error is to loop the hands around the left buttock, so check that you have looped around the more challenging right hip. If possible, hold your left wrist with your right hand. Juice up this twist by straightening as much as possible through the elbows. Try not to touch your buttock with your hands, as your shoulders press away from the ears. After at least five breaths, come out. Kneel to sit symmetrically and feel the differences in your body. Repeat on the second side."

If you feel comfortable, position your left foot further forward, so that your shin is more perpendicular to your body. If you are less flexible, your left knee will point forward while your left foot will be closer to your right hip. Slide your right leg as far back and away as possible. If your left buttock doesn’t touch the floor, place a yoga brick or folded blanket underneath it: you should feel able to lift both hands without any major shift occurring while your hips settle into this stretch. Press your palms to the floor and enjoy the way your spine curves into a long, upward-lifting sweep. Now take your twist to the right. With your left hand placed on your left knee or the ground nearby, reach your right hand to the back of your right leg. Lift tall each time you inhale, then revolve a little more each time you exhale. Imagine a pleasant squeeze through the right lower back and kidney area. Enhance that by sliding your right fingers further down the leg. Choose whether you prefer to allow your right hip bone to slide back, taking it with you into the twist, or whether you would like to increase the intensity by pressing it forward as if to square the hips. Hold for at least five breaths.",

Reach around with your left hand and slide the back of the hand across your lower back. Rotate your palm down to hold your clothing, or cup it across your right hip. If your left foot is near that hip, it might even be possible for you to loop your thumb and first two fingers around your big toe. Hold for five breaths or more.

        "Step your feet 1.2–1.5m (4–5ft) apart. You’ll choose the wider range if you have longer or more flexible legs. Moving from the thigh, turn your right foot in by about 15 degrees. With your left toes pointing straight out to the left, bend your left knee so that it sits above your left ankle. To come into the first stage, reach your left elbow to your left knee and take your right arm up to vertical. Rotating from the shoulder joint, turn your right palm to the left and extend your arm to hover above your right ear.",

Lift your right elbow straight up and also away from your right hip. Now, in a subtle shift of about 5cm (2in), slide your left hip toward the left and deepen the arc from left hip to left armpit, further increasing the length through the right side of the lower back. Finally, imagine that you are a fish, using its side-gills to breathe. Visualize your breath moving in and out of your right-side ribs, as if it were bypassing your nose.",
        "If you would like to go deeper, take the left palm to the floor. Choose whether to straighten your right arm to form the classic side_angle_pose or continue to work with the elbow to fingertips nicely floppy. Enjoy breathing in and out of your right “gills” for several more breaths. Each slow, deep intake of air will stretch the little muscles in between the ribs, as the ribcage expands. This will reset your breathing, so that you can breathe slower and deeper, which will help you feel more relaxed. It sets up a cycle of positive reinforcement: as you relax more, you breathe more slowly; then, as you breathe more slowly, you can relax more. Who would have thought that breathing like a fish could feel so nourishing? Then come back up, to work the second side."

Physically it stretches the whole side of the body, the abdominal obliques and the iliotibial band at the outer thigh, which is tight in many people.

This pose is a case where less is definitely more. To achieve the benefits of it, you will be using the gift of time, rather than an extreme stretch. If it feels good, rest your left ankle on top of your right. Then relax all efforts. Rest here, using soft belly-breathing, for three to five minutes. Set a timer if you like, so that you can be even on each side. Aside from a lovely lengthening along the left side of your body, observe how the right side of your abdomen is pleasantly compressed.

        "Now work the right leg straight, in a way that really allows the hamstrings to let go. Press down with your right hand onto your heel, as if to compress the leg bones back into the hip socket. While your hand presses down and your elbow tries to bend, allow your leg to “win”: it will straighten as the heel presses away. Once your right leg is as straight as it will go, slide your left foot out to straighten the left leg. Then move that foot about 30cm (12in) to the right, to create a half-banana shape. Finally, drape your left arm along the floor overhead, and slide your hand about 20cm (8in) away to the right, to finish your banana shape. As best you can, rest your torso and left shoulder blade down more heavily on the floor, to enhance this side- stretch.",

Don’t skip it – treat it as the valuable investment in your postural health that it is.",
      "steps": [
        "Lie on your back, with your knees bent up and your feet hip-width apart on the floor. Place your hands flat on your abdomen in a diamond shape, with the tips of your thumb and index finger touching each other. Visualize the hammock of muscles running between your tailbone and your pubic bone – your pelvic-floor muscles.",
        "Set up a rocking of your pelvis, forward and backward. As you inhale, curve your lower back off the floor as your pelvis tilts posteriorly. Your fingertips will point down and your thumb tips will point up slightly. When you exhale, allow the squeezing of your abdominal muscles to press the lower back down to the floor. Contract the deeper layers of the abdominal muscles, so that you feel your belly hollowing down away from your palms. As you perform this scooping-out action, you will also be tucking your tailbone under, and your pelvis will tilt anteriorly. This is a natural time to contract your pelvic-floor muscles and draw this sling of muscles up toward the centre of the torso. When you do this, your fingers will point slightly up and your thumbs will angle down.",
        "Continue this slow rocking, as if your abdomen were a compass and you were touching down the North point of it (the tailbone) and the South point (the lowest rib) to the floor. For this entire sequence, move your efforts away from the type of force that makes you furrow your brow or grit your teeth. It’s about a softer focus with a happy curiosity, exploring any areas of duller awareness or weaker muscles. Your relaxed breathing rate will be the guiding factor in how slowly you move. Remember: the slower you move, the more you can develop your ability to “scoop”. You will also have more time to develop your awareness, and this is key to yoga practice.",
        "Now move from your North–South rocking points to explore East and West. First, find the central point that is right in the middle of your North and South. Your lower back will curve gently up from the floor in its natural, neutral arched shape. Then go toward East – contract the abdominal muscles more on your right side, to imprint the right half of your lower back to the floor. Inhale to return to centre, then exhale toward West, working the left half of your belly and focusing on pressing the left lower back to the floor. Mindfully complete ten more East–West moments.",
        "Now work clockwise around the compass. First press down the North point, then East, South and West, to return to North. Stay attuned to any lazy parts that won’t touch down easily through your circle, and then linger there to build awareness and strength. After five complete rounds, return to the centre and circle anticlockwise five times."

Continue to reach away with your tailbone so that your back feels luxuriously long, as you lift your lower back and mid-back up, as high as feels comfortable. Rather than rigidly extending through the elbows, soften them with a gentle bend and allow them to move slightly away from each other. Drop your upper-arm bones into their shoulder sockets, and allow your upper back to broaden and feel heavy on the floor. This will allow you to give yourself a lovely back massage when you begin to move.",

Continue to lengthen the tailbone away, so that the lower back doesn’t feel compressed. Move away from strict circles, and instead let your pelvis swish and slide. Allow your feet to sway so that they respond in a natural way to your hip movements. Let your arms be guided by the movements of the torso and hips. They may feel like moving in different ways from each other, as they respond to the flowing movements of the pelvis. Go with the flow: make it dance- like. Try out different speeds and directions of movement. Besides the core cultivation, you are also developing hamstring and back muscle strength.",
        "To come down in a core-strengthening way, reach your arms overhead along the floor. Lift your heels so your feet are on tiptoes. Tuck your tailbone under to elongate the lower back as much as possible. Touching down from the upper back to the tailbone, lower yourself down. Try to touch each vertebra down one by one. The slower you go, the stronger your workout will be."

It also helps enormously in maintaining good posture.",

Anatomical hip width is often narrower than you might expect: measure it out by placing a fist between your big toes. Inhale and lift your arms overhead as you draw your spine up tall. In particular, pull in the lower back and tilt your pelvis forward as you perform this move.",
        "As you exhale, draw your navel toward the spine and visualize a hollowing-out of the belly. Reverse your pelvic tilt by tucking your tailbone under. This tuck initiates the rolling down as your spine rounds to a C-shape. As you roll down, lower your arms to horizontal, with the palms on either side of your legs. Inhale as you roll back up and activate your back muscles, to create a long, tall spine. While your arms reach overhead, allow your shoulders to drop down away from your ears. Exhale and scoop at the belly as you roll back down. Repeat for ten or 15 more rounds.",
        "Now work another two layers of abdominal muscles: the obliques. Inhale as you flatten your back, lift your chest and reach your arms up. When you exhale, roll down and lower both arms to the outer right thigh. Your torso needs to twist only minimally. Most of the sideways movement is done with the arms, and this is enough to engage your rotational oblique muscles. Inhale up to centre, then exhale and roll down, this time with your arms to the left. As you roll down, keep an eye on your abdomen. If it domes outward, the wrong muscles are working. Don’t roll down as far, so that you can ensure it hollows inward while you develop strength. Complete ten more rounds, alternating sides."

As you exhale, use your abdominal muscles to lift your sacrum off the floor. Your elbows will bend and widen as you lift. As you breathe in, roll your back down to the floor again. It will be a fairly fast movement as you roll up and down. Your hips can flex, so that your knees will move forward as you lift up. Then let the knees move away from you as you roll down, and allow your elbows to straighten. If your lower back feels stiff and clunky, try using soft padding underneath and take only tiny movements. If it still doesn’t feel good, or feels too explosive for your comfort, practise prayer_sweeps instead.",

Pressing down with the palms, inhale and lift up your sacrum, possibly lifting the hips higher this time and working a little further up the spine. If you feel strong in your core and flexible in your forward bends, you will be able to work with straight legs, as shown; but if you need to bend the knees, that works well, too.",
        "Now start to roll back down, using your palms against the floor to help slow this movement down. Exhale, draw your navel toward the spine and take your legs slightly away from vertical. Each time you repeat, take your legs a little further toward the floor. If you are unable to scoop your belly in, that’s a sign you have gone too far: either bend your knees or don’t lower so far, or both. Most people keep their legs closer to vertical than horizontal in this practice. The aim is not to have your legs hovering above the floor, which is super- difficult. It’s more important that your core works correctly here than insist on large movements. Complete ten rounds, then rest."

At this stage, check that your left knee hasn’t crept forward of your left ankle. If it has, that’s a sign you can widen your feet further apart. Once you have your spacing, inhale to straighten up, then exhale to bring your hands to the right knee, as you bend and direct your right knee out wide. Turn this into a flow for five to ten rounds. Move from side to side. If you like, use the smooth ocean_breath to inhale up to centre and exhale to alternate sides.",

Bring your fingers to the floor as you drop your seat down, aiming for your left sitting bone to hover above your left heel. Lift your left heel. On the right side, lift your toes and press the heel of the right foot away to increase the inner-thigh stretch. While easing into this hip-opening action, firm the back muscles along the spine. This will help you to lift your torso up as tall as possible.",
        "Once you have the upward lift in the torso, join the palms together in prayer and, once again, draw yourself upright so that you feel as tall as possible. You may be able to drop your left heel to the floor. Exhale away any tightness in the hips or inner right thigh. After five long, round breaths, draw up your pelvic-floor muscles and use the strength in your legs to come up and move into the right side."

      "steps": [
        "Sit with your legs stretched out wide. Bend your knees up a little, to allow your pelvis to tilt forward enough to enable you to sit up tall with less effort. Notice how the most central part of your two sitting bones connects with the earth. Begin to circle your torso above your hips. Sway to the right side of your sitting bones, then move slowly forward, so that you feel yourself on the front edges of your sitting bones. Continue your circle left and lean back a little, to start to involve your abdominal muscles more. Continue to move in larger and larger circles, until you feel that your arms want to get involved, too. Reach your hands out to one side as you sway to that side, then in front as you move forward. Each time you lean back, bend the elbows to bring your hands closer to your chest.",
        "Once the circling has freed up your pelvis somewhat, straighten your legs and continue in ever-increasing spirals. If you are very flexible and want more anchoring, reach the heels away and press the backs of your knees to the floor. Ensure that you lean well into the back of your circle, to engage your core muscles.",
        "After ten or more spirals, change direction. This time start off with your largest circles. After a few generous circles with no flat edges, reduce the circumference bit by bit. Move in smaller and smaller spirals until, after many rounds, you find yourself sitting still. Rest your hands on your thighs. Once you have found your still centre, above the axis of your pelvis, notice how your torso lifts and your posture may feel long and dignified. While your outer body is now in stillness, notice how your inner body may still feel a little swirly. Your brain might even feel more relaxed by now. Relax into these sensations as you enjoy your breathing for a little longer here."

Then exhale and, folding from the hips, tip forward. First, aim to close the gap between your belly and thigh. Next, reach your heart centre beyond the top knee – imagine your heart is full of runny honey, and aim to drizzle it over the front of the knee. Create a line of energy from your tailbone along the spine and out through the crown of your head. With your right leg on top, you’ll feel the main stretch in the right buttock.

This is your starter pigeon_pose. If you are fairly flexible, ease your left knee further to the left and edge your left foot further forward. Your right foot and knee may even be in one line. Continue to press your right hip forward. If your hips are tighter, position your front leg so that your your knee is further forward than your front foot.",

It can be helpful to place each hand on a yoga brick, too. If you still have knee pain, discontinue this pose. If you are comfortable, move into the active assisted stretch. Keep both knees on the floor, yet contract your muscles as if trying to slide your back knee forward and your front knee backward. Use about 30 per cent of your muscle power and contract for six seconds. Your basic position won’t change, but your hips will float up slightly. Then release the contraction and, on an exhale, soften everything, allow your hips to drop and slide your back leg further away. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds, then reduce the intensity to rest for 30 seconds. Once again, contract your muscles at only 30 per cent intensity, as if to slide your knees toward each other, for six seconds, then release. Slide your legs away, to stretch into the left buttock and the front of the right hip for 30 seconds. Then use your hands to help you come out, ready for the second side."

This reduces any tendency to over- compression, and the benefits are far-reaching – despite the half-and-half name of this pose, there is certainly no dilution of the benefits of the backbends here.

Rest your forehead on the floor and magnetize your chin toward your throat, to ensure you can easily breathe through your nose. To come into the Half-Frog Pose, bend your right knee and reach back with your right hand to grasp the front of the foot. Ease your heel toward your buttock and, if it touches, move the foot to the side to allow the right heel to scrape past the right hip toward the floor. Lowering the heel will occur best if the right buttock is relaxed, so soften it as much as possible. As backbends usually require the activation of the buttocks, it can take a little practice to allow these muscles to release. Once the right foot drops low enough, you may be able to swivel on the heel of the hand so that the right fingers first move out to the right and then point forward, as shown in step 2. This will give a good stretch through the front of the shoulder.",

Lift your left kneecap off the floor as you activate the muscles around the knee to keep it straight. Squeezing on the muscles of the back, lift up your chest. Let your left hand slide toward you, as the chest, shoulder and elbow lift away from the floor. Rather than placing any pressure on the left hand, ensure that all the hard work is being done with your back and the anchoring left-leg muscles. Maintain the sense that you could lift your left hand in the air without causing your chest to drop.",

Then increase the challenge by lifting your left leg in the air, reaching it away as if to make space in the hip joint. Turn your left thumb upward and lift your left arm up, too. While the left arm reaches away, keep the shoulder blade drawing toward the waist, so that you don’t hunch. While your left side is strong, your right side still has a softer energy to it, continuing to allow the right heel to ease downward. Hold for five deliberate and focused breaths.

As well as pressing back and away with your feet, lift them high. Create the largest possible pocket of air between your back and legs. Press your chestbone forward and up. Allow your belly to feel soft. Create a long, full roundness along the front of your body and allow your chest to lift high. If you are more flexible, you may experience a natural rock forward on each exhale and backward on each inhale. Enjoy the movements over five to ten long breaths.",
        "Come down and rest your forehead on the pillow of your hands. Bend your knees so that your feet sit above your knees, then sway your feet both to the right, then both to the left a few times, like windscreen wipers. If you can’t move on to the next stages, repeat the first stage twice more, as each repetition should feel better.",
        "Prepare to come up again. This time wrap your right hand around the inside of your right ankle and grasp your left inner ankle with your left hand. Inhale to lift up and enjoy the broadening of the collar bones and the enhanced roll-back of the shoulders. Hold for five to ten breaths once again. Then rest down.",
        "For the final stage, reach your arms back and, crossing at your wrists, swap ankles. Hold your right inner ankle in your left hand and your left inner ankle in your right. Ensure that you have actually crossed over at your wrists rather than your ankles. Each time your breathe in, feel the expansion of your ribcage and soar skyward; each time you breathe out, allow the abdomen to soften and relax. After five to ten breaths come down and rest."

        "From all fours, bring your left knee close to your left wrist, and your left foot a little toward your right wrist. Slide your right leg back in a straight line, to come into a pigeon_pose. It’s important to be able to settle yourself toward the floor so that your hips can receive the stretch. If your left buttock doesn’t touch the floor, support it with a yoga block or folded blankets. You’ll need to be able to stay grounded while lifting both hands up, without tilting sideways. If your left buttock touches the floor, enhance the gluteal stretch by moving your left knee further to the left and easing your foot further forward, so that your shin is more perpendicular to your torso. Check that your right ankle is directly behind your right hip, and that your right knee is not bent out to the right. If it bends out, you need to lift your seat higher, so grab some more padding. When you are ready, bend your right knee. Grasp your right foot with your right hand. Press your foot back against your hand and use this action to sit your torso up taller, working deeper into your backbend. Reach your left arm upward, palm up, and join the tips of your thumb and index finger. Focus now on lifting up out of the lower back and carving the concavity deeper into the mid- and upper back. Feel your breath move into the front of your torso to help it broaden, lighten and lift with each inhalation.",
        "After five to ten breaths in the initial pigeon_pose, move into the pigeon_crescent_pose. Bring your right foot in close to the body. Twisting around to the right, draw your right foot in as close as possible with your left hand. Now slip your right arm behind the right ankle to nestle the foot into your elbow nook. Once you have secured the foot, reach your left arm forward, up and back, to hook the fingers of both hands together.",
        "Once you are locked in, press the right side of your ribcage forward to come out of the twist as much as possible. Press your right foot back, so that you have a nice strong action to work against. Use each inhalation to bolster the squeezing-forward of your right side. At the same time, press your right foot back to develop your backbend further. Hold for five long, smooth breaths. Then come out and practise side two."

Another trick is to keep a light feeling of drawing your navel to the spine. This will lessen the compression in your lower back and bring more comfort.

As you do this, lift the chest higher. Consider the lifting arm as an extension of your spine and allow its reach to lift you taller.",

Inhale to lift your heart centre, and return your left arm to vertical. Then exhale to lower it forward and down, swapping hands so that your left palm is on your sacrum. Inhale to sweep your right arm forward and up. Exhale as you reach it back and curve into your backbend. Press your hips forward. Inhale to lift up as symmetrically as possible, then exhale to swap hands at your sacrum again. Continue for five more rounds, going a little deeper as you warm up.",

Your toes can be tucked under or, for a greater challenge, un-tucked, with the tops of the feet flat on the floor. Your left arm continues to help elevate your spine. Hold for several breaths before inhaling back up, ready to change sides.",

Continue to lift through the centre of the chest and press the fronts of your thighs forward, while your navel moves inward. Roll your shoulders back and ensure that your neck is comfortable.

Tip to the right to take the weight off your left shoulder, so that you can roll it under. Then tilt to the left to roll your right shoulder under. Create a gulley of air space between your shoulder blades. Work your leg muscles to maintain the height of your hips, and move your chestbone toward your chin. Hold for five to ten long breaths.

Lean to the right, so that your left shoulder lifts off from the floor and, exaggerating that shoulder roll-back movement even more, reach your left hand to hold your right ankle.

The right side of your ribcage will tend to droop, so re-double your lifting efforts here. Make your torso as symmetrical as possible.

If possible, walk them in toward your hands to make your shape more circular. Straighten your elbows as much as possible and move your chest forward, away from your buttocks. Sometimes it’s easy to forget to breathe when you are upside-down, so keep your breathing steady and regular. If your toes have turned out, rearrange the feet by bringing the big toes closer together, so that the second toes can point forward. After five or more breaths, tuck your chin in and bend the elbows, to lower down with control. Rest, then repeat two more rounds. Despite the fatigue factor, each round will feel easier, as if the joints have been better lubricated.",

Firm the left buttock, ready to bear more weight. Activate your abdominal muscles and bend your right knee as you lift your right foot off the floor. Bring your right thigh in toward your belly, keeping your knee well bent. Lengthen your right leg straight up, as vertical as your flexibility will allow. Point the toes initially, then peel your right toes back, so that the ball of the foot is the highest part of the pose. Hold for five breaths. To come out, bend the right knee in first, then lower the leg with control. Stabilize, then turn your right foot and knee out 2.5cm (1in), ready to lift the left side."

The idea is to create a gulley between your shoulder blades and bring your elbows closer together, which will allow your torso to lift up more. Eventually your upper-arm bones will be parallel and your hands will be able to walk down from your sacrum to hold your mid-back.",

Once you have set up your foundation and are feeling comfortable, you will be ready to lift your legs higher and will find the angles that suit your body best. Move the chest to your chin, lift more through the front of the torso and elevate the legs, so that the whole shape is more vertical. Whatever your shape, remember that you are getting all the great benefits of Shoulder-Stand, so leave the ego out of it and choose whichever option truly suits your body best. Start with holding for 30 seconds, then build up to five minutes with regular practice. Over those five minutes you will need to make small adjustments to maintain your lift and symmetry. Certainly do this, but try not to fidget unnecessarily. Focus on lifting through long, straight legs, on your breath and on your stillness.

        "From Shoulder-Stand, fold at the hips and lower your legs overhead. If you are flexible in your forward bending, you may be able to touch your feet to the floor, toes tucked under. If you can’t touch down, continue to support your back with your palms. In this case, allow your knees to bend while the toes float. You can allow the spine to round softly in this hovering position, which is more restful. However, if you can touch your toes down, lift more through the spine to bring it a little more vertical, so that the hips stack more over the shoulders. Then interlace your fingers and reach your arms back along the floor. Your arms and shoulder line will create a tripod of support, making a base from which to lift the torso. This pose works using your three blankets initially; then with time and experience, and if it suits your neck, you can reduce to none."

        "Once you have come out of your inversion, lie flat on your back with your knees bent up. If you are using blankets, move down so that your head and back are on the same level. Come into position without twisting your neck to either side, as it’s important to first release the neck in a forward and backward direction. Press your chin in toward your throat to flatten your neck toward the floor. Feel how the head slides away from the shoulders to allow the neck to lengthen. Stay for two breaths.",

Drawing the chin toward the throat, lift up through the chest and come up to rest on your forearms. You will be looking forward at this stage. Then take your torso back as you lift your chin and let the crown of the head move toward the floor. As the angle of your elbows increases, the crown of your head may lightly touch the floor. Ensure that most of the weight is borne by the forearms and lower body. Hold for five to ten breaths. To come out, lift the head just enough to un-wedge it from the floor, and lower yourself all the way down, to lie on your back. Hug your knees into your belly and practise another couple of neck flexions (step 1) and extensions (step 2).",
        "After your neck releases, roll your whole body to the side, head included. You still have not twisted the neck. Come up to sitting. Once you are sitting, you can turn your head from side to side. head_beyond_the_knee_pose is one of my favourite postures to practise after inversions."

Aim to have the bones of your neck fairly vertical. If they are not, roll back down to your forehead, then adjust by moving your forehead in closer to your knees before coming back into the pose.",
        "Now practise the correct setting of the shoulders. Slide your shoulder blades toward your waist and lift the tops of your shoulders away from the ears, so that they form a horizontal line. Have your upper-arm bones parallel, so that your elbows point straight backward. This will let you better control how much weight is on your head. Aim for it to take around 20 per cent of the weight, but test the waters by doing less. Lift your back to a high, rounded shape. After three to ten breaths, rest back down to child_pose or, if it feels right, proceed to the next stage.",

The seat edges should be about 16cm (6in) apart, just enough for you to slip your head through, but narrow enough to support your shoulders. Fold two matching blankets so that they create a broad pad about 10cm (4in) high. Ensure they are exactly the same height, as they will become your base. Slide your hands in under the pads, so that the palms are resting on the seat of the chair. Your wrists will be near the front of the chair.",
        "Your chairs should be just wide enough apart for you to slip your head in between them. Do this now, and position your shoulders about halfway along the chair edge (deeper in than your wrists). Step your feet away and let the whole top of your shoulder line rest on the padded supports. Lift up to tiptoes and walk your feet in toward the chairs. At a certain point you won’t be able to walk in anymore without bending your knees. This is the place to kick up from. Lift one leg up as high as possible.",
        "Bend the other knee and, when you are ready, kick up that leg and then the other (or, with experience, lightly float your legs up). Take both heels to the wall. In time you can practise not touching the wall at all. Once you are up, get as symmetrical as possible. It helps to have someone stand back opposite you, to check your alignment. Keep your breathing long and steady. Often the reason people come out of inversions is not that they were physically unable to hold it for longer, but because they forgot to keep breathing. Practise moving your feet away from the wall, to free-balance. Stay for three breaths initially, building up to a minute over repeated regular practice.",
        "To come down, scissor one leg forward, toes tucked under, and land lightly down. Once both feet are on the floor, step backward, releasing the head from the chairs. Take a low squat or kneeling position for a minute, until you are ready to come up."

Lower the left leg out to the side, possibly as far as touching the toes to the floor and pressing the left heel away. Continue to lift the shoulder line away from the floor. Lighten the amount of weight on the head by keeping an even pressure through left and right forearms and pressing down. Maintain the internal thigh rotation of the right leg, reaching it up and away.

You are using your legs as resistance for your abdominal muscles to work against. As you do this, your hips will move backward from their starting alignment over the shoulders. Inhale as you hold the legs low, then exhale and lift them to vertical. Inhale once you are upright, then exhale to lower again. The slower you go, the more strengthening this is, as you are not relying on momentum or gravity.

Spread your fingers wide, and even out the pressure between the inner and outer palms by pressing your thumb side down a little more. Tuck your toes under and lift your knees, so that you come to a classic_downward_facing_dog_pose . Walk your feet in toward your hands. Bring your shoulders above your knuckles and lift your hips as high as you can. Lift one leg in the air as high as possible. If you feel you can maintain the strength and the lift in the shoulders, you are ready to kick up. If you feel you might collapse, then this is far enough for today. Instead, continue practising Downward-Facing Dog, the Plank position and general shoulder-stretching poses, to get ready over time.",
        "If you are ready to kick up, bend both knees. Contract your abdominal muscles to prepare to lift, as they will help the journey skyward. Use the lower leg to give a strong, confident kick, so that you can float both legs up as you straighten them. Once the top leg touches the wall, your second leg will follow on and both heels will touch the wall. Keep your abdominal muscles activated, so that over time you can bring one leg – and then both – away from the wall to free-balance. Hold for up to a minute, then scissor your legs to come down. Bend your knees to the floor and take your hips to your heels, to rest in child_pose . When you sit up, circle your wrists in both directions to release any strain."

      "introduction": "This pose feels like such a delight when all the elements combine well. When the shoulders are strong enough to support you confidently, yet flexible enough to allow a flight-like lift, you can soar upward with joy and lightness. I love to practise a set of abdominal- strengtheners before this pose, as they help enormously in free-balancing.",
      "steps": [
        "Kneel in front of a wall and bring your elbows to the floor, no wider than your shoulders. Have your index finger pointing forward, about 10cm (4in) from the wall. Adjust your forearms so that they are parallel, then spread the fingers and root down, particularly through the inner wrists and thumb knuckles. This will prevent the thumbs from sliding toward each other, which tends to happen here.",
        "Tuck the toes under and lift the knees to come into an inverted V- shape. On tiptoes, and with the knees bent, lift up from the shoulders, so that the crown of the head passively lifts away from the floor. As your shoulder muscles work, develop your shoulder flexibility by moving your armpits in and up toward the fronts of your thighs. Aim to create a straight line from your elbows through your shoulders to your hips. If your head is on the floor, you need to develop your flexibility (with pyramid_prayer ) and your strength (with three_legged_dogs ) before progressing to step 3.",
        "Walk your feet toward your elbows a little. Then realign again, by lifting the shoulders away from the floor to create that clean line from the elbow through the shoulder to the hip. Walk in again until you can’t walk any more. This is your natural kicking point. Lift one leg up. Bend both knees, then kick up while you straighten both knees. A strong, committed kick up will take both legs together to the wall. At no time during forearm_balance will your head touch down on the floor – that’s a sign to work on your flexibility some more. Each time you practise, keep your body in balance by changing your kicking leg.",
        "The next step is to move one foot, then both feet, away from the wall to a free-balance. Once you are able to hold the full balance for one minute, you can move 40cm (15in) away from the wall and practise kicking up to the free-balance. When you do this, the leading leg will momentarily come close to touching the wall, only to be immediately counterbalanced by the trailing leg. Draw both legs together, contract your core muscles and press the balls of the feet up to the sky, to contribute to the lift that your shoulders are continually giving. Continue to press the floor away actively with the forearms, inner wrists and fingertips. Stay for up to 20 slow breaths, then scissor the legs to come down lightly, with toes tucked under. Rest in the child_pose ."

Sit back on your heels and fold forward to rest your forehead on the floor. Drape your arms beside your legs, palms up. Allow your shoulders to roll in. Adjust as required. Some people prefer their head turned to one side, in which case do alternate between left and right. If your forehead doesn’t touch the floor, try bringing your arms forward to make a little shelf for your forehead with one or two stacked fists; again, let the shoulders slouch happily."

Fold a blanket to create a firm roll about 10cm (4in) thick. Place it near the top of a bolster to form a T-shape. With feet together, but knees wide, lay your belly and chest down on the bolster. Reach your arms forward, to rest the area around your elbows on top of the roll. Bring your forehead to rest on the edge of the roll. You want to ensure that the height and position are right, so that your nose is clear to breathe easily (with a light tucking in of your chin) and your neck feels comfortable in the slightly flattened position. Placing the forehead on a yoga brick placed in front of the roll works for many.

Your chin, chestbone, pubic bone and big toes should be in a line. Most importantly, you should feel supremely comfortable. Stay for at least five minutes and up to 15. To come out, bend your knees and press your feet into the wall. Slide your bolster to the side, then lower your hips back down and roll out to the side. After several breaths, use your arms to push yourself up to sitting.",

Take a soft belt and tie it around your mid-thighs; this will enable your leg muscles to fully release from the effort of subtly keeping the legs together. Place a light covering on your eyes. To help those ever- busy hands surrender to stillness, place a light weight like an eye- pillow in each palm. You will continue to cool down as you rest, particularly with your feet up high, so be sure to stay warm: cover yourself from the feet down with a soft blanket."

Lift up to position your hands on your front knee and come into a Flying High Dragon. Check that your lower back feels good here. Remember: with all yin postures, the idea is to strengthen the body by creating an appropriate stress in the joints, but not to go into such intensity that there is a feeling of pain.",

Build up to holding your chosen pose for three to five minutes – set a timer, if you like. If you feel it predominantly in the groin, that’s the liver and kidney meridians. If the work is more at the front of the thigh of your back leg, the stomach and spleen meridians are being activated. If you feel it more at the outer right thigh, that’s the gall-bladder meridian. When your torso is lifted in the Flying High Dragon you may feel it in the lower back, working the urinary, bladder and, again, the kidney meridians."

Slide your right forearm crossways, thumb up. Reach it to the left, straightening the elbow as much as you can. Then slide your left forearm away to the right. Once it’s as straight as it will go, you will find that you can squeeze the right arm straighter, too. Shuffle a little to get your hands one more notch away from each other. Now “walk” your hips forward, to allow your forehead to rest on the floor. Ensure you have come forward enough that your neck is clear, but not so far that your nose compresses to the floor. If you can’t reach the floor with ease, rest your forehead on a foam yoga block. Stay for two to three minutes. Then change to the other side.",

Notice the relaxed blossoming outward of the belly as you inhale. Embrace the soft belly-breathing that comes with this full yogic breath. Observe the movements of the back. The changes here are subtle, so feel free to gently exaggerate your breathing, to better clarify how the lower back moves. Imagine the breath swirling around your lower back, dissolving any tension it meets. Stay here for one to three minutes.",

Check that you are cupping your ribcage rather than the waist, and that you can then soften the shoulders. If this position doesn’t work well for you, cross your arms in front, to give yourself a hug, and wrap your palms around the sides of the ribcage. Notice how the breath moves into the sides of the torso. It’s often helpful to consciously expand the intakes of air, to let the breath open into the side body. Notice how each inhalation will lift and broaden the ribs, while on each exhalation they drop down and narrow. Once you have done several slow, deeper-than-normal breaths, you may be able to return to a lighter breath and still sense this action of the ribs. Continue to practise for one to three minutes.",

You may still feel the warm touch of the palms, as a reminder of where to breathe into. Visualize a balloon in the centre of the torso. Let it expand as you breathe in, and shrink a little as you breathe out. Imagine it expanding fairly uniformly in all directions – forward, backward and to each side. As you inhale, let it also expand downward toward the pelvic floor and upward toward the base of the throat. As you exhale, allow it to condense evenly, too.

Incorporating this into your yoga practice will give it a whole new sense of focus and flow. It allows you to tap into the majestic tidal ebb and flow of each sweeping, flowing breath. This breath can be used as a standalone practice, but it can also be used throughout the entire active part of your physical yoga practice. It can take a short while to feel really comfortable with this breath, but it may take many months of regular practice to incorporate it fully into your yoga poses. However, it’s so worth it. Integrating the ocean_breath will elevate your whole physical yoga practice and give it that sense of moving meditation that we often long for – and then you will understand why its Sanskrit name, ujjayi , is translated as “victorious breath”.",
      "steps": [
        "The exhalation part of this ocean_breath is the easiest part to pick up first. Bring a small constriction to the airway at the base of the throat, and breathe out slowly through an open mouth. As you do this, make a sigh, like you’re fogging up a mirror. You will make a light throaty noise, like the sound of a snoring baby. Notice how your throat feels warm. As you relax into this part of the practice, your exhalation may start to lengthen out. Be sure to allow your inhalations to extend correspondingly, in order to stay balanced.",
        "Move from the open-mouthed exhalation to the closed mouth. Keep that same throaty breath, but place your lips together and send the air out though the nostrils. You’ll experience the air moving through the throat, and it almost feels as if the nostrils are bypassed. The sound will be a little smaller, but still audible to anyone right next to you. After a minute or so, take a rest. If you feel comfortable, continue to the next stage. If it feels stressful, stop for now and practice for short lengths of time over days and weeks, until it feels easy.",
        "Still constricting the airway, inhale. It can be helpful to imagine that you’re breathing through a little hole at the base of the throat. Check that the breath really does feel as if it comes from the throat, and that it’s not a nasal sound. Although there is a constriction at the throat, you need to feel softness and ease there. Work on getting a constant rate of air flow on both parts of the breath – in and out. Both inhalation and exhalation should have a sound like the distant ocean. Enjoy the tidal flow of your breath. Practise this glottal breathing for anywhere from a minute up to the full duration of your yoga practice, breaking from it during your final relaxation to return to your natural breath."

I love the way it makes the lungs feel light and expanded. Each breath is slowed and allowed to expand out into its four parts. Click here for a free guided audio download of this sequence. There is dedicated time for the two retentions: the nourishing fullness of the inhalation and that delightful emptiness of the exhalation. The pause after the inhalation allows you to get the most energy from that intake of air. Both pauses deepen your concentration, as does the mental counting. Counting takes the mind away from those mundane everyday thoughts and moves it into that elusive present- moment awareness, which elevates us and makes us feel happy.

Meter the timing, so that this constant air flow fills the lungs to comfortably brimming, just as you reach the number four.",

We realize there is actually no need to change anything at all in order to experience wholeness and serenity.",

If it feels comfortable and effortless, narrow the distance between the lips – perhaps bringing them so close together as to imagine holding a paper tissue between them. This narrow aperture should create no tension around your soft lips. It should assist the exhalation in lengthening out a little, so do ensure that you keep a nicely balanced breath. Continue to take leisurely inhalations though both nostrils.",

I like to imagine a neat little cane basket floating out in front, ready to accept anything I want to put in it. Without speeding up the breathing at all, continue to watch this basket. The beautiful thing about observing these concerns is that they are now externalized. Being out in front, they are no longer a part of you. You can experience yourself freely, without these troubles.",
        "To close, decide where you would like to place the issues at the end of your golden thread. It’s up to your imagination, so it can be anywhere at all. And it’s also up to you whether or not you choose to take any of them back. Then return to your easy breathing, in and out through the nose, to calmly watch the breath for several minutes."

If this sounds like fanciful yogic folklore to you, keep in mind that yoga practitioners the world over swear by this one and love the effects. This take on the classic alternate-nostril breathing is a super practice, day or night, which adds quality to your life. It is great in the morning, to set you up for a calm and more focused day; beneficial at night, to decompress after a long day or help you go off to sleep; fabulous before or after a meeting; and lovely to lead you into meditation.

Once your lungs have emptied, hold the breath out for three counts while you lower your right hand to rest on your thigh again.",

The body often likes a little weight on it, so try placing a light weight such as an eye- pillow on each palm, with your thumbs draped on top. Place another eye-pillow over the heart centre.

You now have a focal point for each part of the breath. On each full yogic breath, you will inhale and follow the breath up from the navel to the heart. On each exhalation, you’ll drop your awareness from the crown of the head down to the heart. Continue this process for two or three minutes.",

Areas of deficiency and excess can even out. You will feel expansive and yet grounded, playful and yet determined, and will balance silence with action. Masculine and feminine, and any other opposite qualities residing within you, will become less distant. You’ll be able to experience how being in balance is so much more comfortable than being out of balance.",

Breathe into this spiral of colour, allowing it to swell, then as you exhale let the colours diffuse through the whole body. Continue this for another minute or, if you have time, longer. Then just stay resting for a while. When you are ready to come out, sense your physical body. Make tiny movements with your fingers and toes. Expand those movements to your ankles and wrists. Move and stretch in any way that feels good. Open the eyes and return slowly and gracefully to your outer world."

        "Let go of sounding your sounds of gratitude. Stay sitting and let the vibrations of the sound continue to resonate. Once the vibrations dissipate, let your breath be your focal point. Observe any effects of doing this practice. Then open your eyes."

      "practice_note": "You don’t have to fold your legs up, pretzel-like, to meditate. Any upright seated position can work well. Sit in a chair; ensure that your feet touch the floor easily and place them on a higher support if they don’t. To help take the stress out of your shoulders, fold a blanket several layers thick and place it on the tops of your thighs. Place your hands on the blanket, palms up or down. The aim is to have your elbows positioned exactly under your shoulder joints and bent at 90 degrees, so make the blanket higher if necessary. There are many variations of this loving_kindness_meditation, and I believe each is of great value in our modern world. I have included a version that uses the breath as a really nice anchor. A good intention to start off with is to vow to open to this practice, for the benefit of all beings.",
